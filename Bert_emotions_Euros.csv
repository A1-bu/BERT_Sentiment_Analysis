Foden and Kane, absolutely no impact whatsoever the whole tournament. Southgate, anyone with eyes could see Kane and Foden were doing nothing the whole tournament.

For England, we almost secured yet another sucker-punch but felt Southgate played all his aces in getting the equaliser.  I felt all the players played okay but were just generally outclassed (aside from Kane).  Shout out to Shaw who I think dealt with the threat of Yamal admirably considering the amount of football he has played.  We have a young team with loads of potential - would be great to see what a more forward thinking manager could do with them.

He nailed it in the semis, but he isn't immune from criticism.

The best moments come when they don't seem like Southgate's England, when they turn the tempo up few teams can get close.

"Southgate's decision will always puzzle me. Anyone who watches football will know that Kane needs players with pace running beyond him for him to excel. He plays Foden, Bellingham & Saka, that only makes sense if you plan to dominate the ball in the opponents half and play a really high line. 

I have no problem with sitting deep and trying to hit Spain on the break but fuck me surely you would play Watkins and/or Gordon with Kane. Spain just pushed up because they know Kane and Foden won't run past them.",1720991746,17,,3,27

But it has to be the last tournament for Kane and Southgate. Whatever was left of Kane's legs have gone (we'll no doubt find out he's been carrying an injury and playing through) and he doesn't work as part of a counter attacking team. 

Southgate has worked wonders with this squad over the last few years and obviously got us to a semi final and two finals, but we need someone who is willing to make bolder decisions quicker to push this team forward. Kane should have been hooked sooner (shouldn't have started tbf), and we should have made more subs once we scored as Spain were out on their feet at that point.",1720992123,20,:Rotherham_United:,0,22

"The lead up to the final has seen a lot of praise for Southgate for both present and past performance but with the sole focus of it being on where the team has finished. While I admit in football this is the only metric that matters there have been signs throughout and this tournament have put them front a centre.

Shocking string of performances from the likes of Kane, Foden, Bellingham and I'd even argue Rice yet not a chance of them getting dropped despite signs of immediate improvement when changes have been made. This has been Southgateball  to me from day one and I don't think he should be getting nearly the level of respect he has gotten from the British media. 

Hes been blessed with a spectacular generation of talent and while others with similar levels have failed in comparison he has shown very little if at all capability of harvesting and growing the pieces he has been dealt. He seems a nice bloke and all that but this team has played horribly this tournament bar about  minutes and he's been played a generous hand in all his tournaments.

Failing to make substitutions at critical moments. England were well on top until the equaliser and then spent  minutes on the backfoot before any further subs were made. Kyle Walker was ultimately culpable for both goals and had Southgate subbed him for Trippier  minutes earlier he probably would have blocked the cross for -.

. The best team of the tournament won.

. Gareth Southgate know how to make subs. But I wonder how the game would look if it was Kane coming on fresh at min instead of Watkins. And i wonder what the game would look like if there was a player in front of Luke Shaw on the left. And I wonder how Bellingham played + minutes every single match this tournament.

. Jordan Pickford is a horrible sweeper keeper. And i think the stat for how many times he immediately gave back possession after England finally got it will be shocking. (he had a good match otherwise)

. The ref didn't give England a chance in extra time, ¬Ω minute of players being ""injured"" during extra time and he adds no time for that.

. It was a good final of two very hard working teams. Better than i expected but of course i'd love to see more chances :)",1720990874,8,:Sweden:,0,26

"Congratulations Spain, better team.

This has to be the end of Southgate era, England cannot keep playing this fucking type of football anymore under him. It's going to be complete waste of a generation of talent. I will give Southgate credit for bringing in young players when he first got the job and bringing stability to the national team but over time he's getting exposed in many areas on management.

Also Trent being on bench this much in a major tournament not even injured is just a high crime in Football. Especially when Trippier and Shaw have not  played since February. He 'experiments' Trent in midfield and gets sidelined ever since because of it yet refuses to try him in LB but gives it to Trippier.

"We held our own. We had our chances. We played with heart. No one made a mistake. A young, inexperienced squad has gained massive experience. We won a penalty shoot out. We won games facing adversity. We lost to the outright best team of the tournament. If I was offered this pre tournament I'd have took it gratefully. 

We do need a new manager, one more tactically astute but also able to galvanise a team with limited time. I don't believe there's a manager who can do that.

We need to be ruthless, drop Kane, Walker, Trippier and the last couple of old guard. Promote our younger players and programs into a new cycle. I expect a  year dip with earlier knock outs before another peak from - years out.

You can blame him for lineup selection, and boring tactics, but British pundits overrate a good number of British players because they play their club football with great coaches and non-Brit players that make the game significantly easier for them. 

If Southgate is fired, I would bet any futures that include ""Foden less than . goals at  World Cup"" because Southgate isn't the reason he constantly fills space that isn't there and bogs down so much of England's buildup. Foden is. 

Stones and Walker were good this tournament, but they looked much less confident and coordinated with players like Guehi, Mainoo, Trippier, and Trent next to them than with Rodri and Ake. 

Southgate might be remembered as Roberto Martinez with Belgium for ruining England's ""golden generation"" when I think he should be remembered as a Fernando Santos with Portugal type - a poor manager who got blamed for his team's shortcomings even when they weren't his fault.",1720992761,8,:Real_Madrid:,27,20

Foden and Saka could be high and go seek champions based on how invisible they were. What was Sakas role? Sit back  feet from goal and do nothing?
