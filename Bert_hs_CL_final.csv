MBapp has not been the same player for a almost a full year now.

It's got nothing to do with him playing in a new club/league or even playing another position.

At some point we gotta judge him by what he's been showing us for a while now and not by what he was at his peak.

I know it feels weird to say about a guy who has yet to turn  but truth is he just isn't close to the guy ha was - years ago. Not even close. Not physically, not mentally.

yo MBapp on that Real team would be a whole other story",1732744884,167,,1,2

"Conor Bradley, take a bow. Was absolutely boss. Rock solid defensively and was extremely effective with his runs inside Mo. Just makes me more confident that if Trent does decide he wants to join that lot, then we'll be completely fine. Looks like his injury was just a bit of tightness. Trent should be good for City if needed. 

Konate is the big concern. Pray it's not as bad as it seems and it's just an awkward twist/knocking of knees that hasn't done any damage. Would be a big miss. 

Job almost done in the CL. One win out of the last  and that pretty much locks up top  (might even mathematically do it depending who plays who).",1732745473,240,,1,2

He was trying to get in Salah's head and press him near the halfway line on the right wing. Also left his post to get close to VvD and left Gakpo to attack the space he left behind for the goal.",1732747947,58,:Czech_republic:,1,2

Something is fundamentally wrong with Madrid this year. It isn't just injuries and Mbappe struggling it's much more deeper than that. It's mostly the same team that only lost to one team all of last season. Idk if Mbappe is just washed or he's in a rough patch he's only  years old he's supposed to be in his prime maybe he peaked to early or Madrid doesn't play to his strengths and is a bad fit for him. Maybe the next coach can unlock Mbappe and he can finally be the player we expected him to be.,1732750991,45,:r_soccer_user:,1,2

"Bellingham is an interesting player in that he gets more dangerous the closer he is to goal, but he's such a well rounded midfielder that he can put a shift in anywhere. This means people expect him to be a G/A demon when in reality he can do a lot of midfielder things defensively and offensively at an above average level. Also real madrid ask a lot of him and most of the time don't really have him close to goal where he can pop up in the  yd box for chances.

Now people seem to have realised in match thread comments how crucial Vini is for the squad. He can change the game he wants. He has that flair, ambition everything else about the game.

"Vinicius has twice as much football as Mbapp in him and I'd wager even Rodrygo would've done better. His mentality is also one of the worst of the pitch. Sulking, feeling sorry for himself. Vinicius on his worst days always tries to put the team on his shoulders, causes some bust-up with the opponent for no reason and insults the ref's entire line because he didn't get an easy foul. 

Mbapp is just there. Loses the ball when he tries to dribble, misplaces a pass and causes a great counter by Liverpool time and time again. Vazquez, Ceballos and Fran Garc√≠a came on with more balls to try and turn the game around than Mbapp has shown in the past few months.

I've always thought it wrong for the fanbase to revere a player who has achieved nothing yet for Real Madrid and had only played the club like a fiddle in the past few years. Now you reap what you sow. No balls to sub him off. He has to play every game, and at least  minutes. Welcome to Mbapp FC. Truly the worst timeline.

Mbappe is just void of confidence. He's geniuenly mentally not there. I'm not saying this as a insult but it's clear on his face that he is more afraid of doing a mistake than he is happy if it turns out okay. That penalty was also just sad to see.

He needs to rediscover his strengths and work on his focus. Not sure he'll have the luxury of time at Madrid though",1732745312,3,:Ajax:,1,2
Eh. He's fit. His pace has recently returned. He's just not dribbling because he doesn't think he beat Liverpool's defenders and opt for passes instead.,1732744958,1,,1,2
He has been looking like that for months now,1732745125,1,:Lille_OSC:,1,2
What players have looked any good against this Liverpool team this year?,1732745186,1,:Chelsea:,1,2
Factos,1732744527,1,:FC_Barcelona:,1,2
"Genuinely don't think he was that horrible, just poor overall offense on the team.. he seemed to dribble well. Also had a terrible penalty which eclipses everything else.",1732744697,-1,:FC_Barcelona:,1,2
"If by another you mean vinicius back, then yes",1732745298,1,:Real_Madrid:,1,2
ONly because Endrick was throwing himself at Ibous legs the whole time the dirty little cunt.,1732744802,28,:r_soccer_user:,1,2
yeah just that endricks only motivation was to hurt a liverpool player,1732744860,21,,1,2
Endrick is a cunt. Dude is stealing wages and just being a goon.,1732745463,4,:Richmond_Kickers:,1,2
"I mean I am a Liverpool fan, but Madrid is really not just minus Vini. Cama went out injured, Carvajal, Alaba, Militao, Tchou, Rodrigo, Vini and I'm pretty sure I've dropped about a  more names on their injury list",1732744729,5,:Liverpool:,1,2
He was one of the better players because Liverpool weren't afraid of him and let him roam free.,1732745166,3,,1,2

Jude was more than decent given the circumstances IMO,1732745051,17,:FC_Barcelona:,1,2

He's a cunt,1732746487,16,:Chelsea:,1,2
He is good but this season he's not playing in a position that allows him to score goals. He's been picking up the slack of Mbappe and Vini defensively.,1732746647,10,,1,2
"As a Barca fan I can tell you didnt watch Iniesta play when he was .  Bellingham is pretty fucking Young man , give him a break .

He was way better last year when he didnt have to do Kroos job too",1732748763,10,,1,2
He's worth half a jones,1732746628,8,,1,2
"He was alright, he has to do all the hard work with lazy gits like Mbappe in the team.",1732747715,10,:Liverpool:,1,2
"Tell u what, buy a time machine, go back to last year, and follow him through all the season  (not only CL and euros, but the league as well) and tell me how is he overrated? He was dominating most of the games he played, he dipped at the end but only because he was playing with an injury. He was awarded the MVP of the league and with good reason. This season he's been playing a different role, I wish he could go back, but he's still a machine. Absolutely not overrated.",1732751070,2,,1,2
It's insane you typing this he was BY FAR AND AWAY our best player and it's not even close,1732746772,9,:Real_Madrid:,1,2

This Real Madrid team is full of stars, the attention always shifts to those players instead of a workhorse like Bellingham, he'll never be noticed the right way nor appreciated.",1732753745,2,:Czech_republic:,1,2
I get your point but he's so sooo young. Probably not wise to call his career on what we've seen thus far,1732746500,1,,1,2
"Bellingham is good if you play him in his position as an .
Not a  or a .",1732747232,1,:Liverpool:,1,2

Look Arsenal fans have been on another one lately seeing as they thought it would be them capitalizing on a City down year but there's not really much basis to say Slot is better than Arteta yet. What Arteta has done with Arsenal is the sign of a great manager. The question remains if he's the one to get them over the line or not,1732822716,1,:Liverpool:,1,2

The entire team is trying to help him as best as they can but he has only been sliding further and further. Even when he came here, he wasn't there but there were certainly signs of promise.

"It is a lot more patient and less frenetic than it was with Klopp. Some elements like counter attacks from opponent set-pieces are still there, but much more patient with the ball. Not forcing it as much around the opponents box. More willing to take low percentage shots from time to time.

Where Klopp would be frustrated by low block teams not wanting to engage, Slot is perfectly happy to keep the ball and build pressure through possession.

One of the big differences between the previous and current version is under Klopp, we would crank up the pressure after scoring to try and get a second quickly. They don't do that as much under Slot, which makes it feel more like a tightrope walk, but the stats show we are actually conceding less chances and xG this season, so it is more solid.",1732749767,43,:Liverpool:,1,2
"Bit of both.

The basic foundations are there (counter pressing, being direct) but slot has different implementations of the same ideas.

Klopp almost exclusively played --, slot is more flexible and he plays a flexible --- that shifts between a -- or -- depending on phase of play. The overall play is less aggressive, more control, but also more solid defensively. The full backs are less influential in his system, but the wingers are more influential and asked to do more. 

You could say he was lucky to inherit the right caliber of players who already have a general idea of how to play his system, but he's also been very effective in tweaking to suit the players he has and communicating what he wants and implementing it. 

One thing that is evident about slot vs klopp is that he is much more flexible tactically, and I even think his game management is better. There have been  or  games already where his side starts slow, he takes the first half to figure out what the other side is doing, then makes big changes at half time and turns the game around. He isn't against ugly and pragmatic tactics.

It isnt all rosy though, the team does look vulnerable if you have a team capable of playing through your press and he's been quite reliant on a few players.",1732758372,13,,1,2
"Latter. Slowed the game and put more emphasis on possession, control, and recycling the ball instead of springing counters. Kind of still feasting on the attacking movements Klopp coached as many goals still come from either counters or set pieces, but he's given the team control over games which was at times lacking last year",1732749374,27,,1,2
"He's tweaked things here and there but not much more than that, the style is very similar to the way the team played in the - and - seasons, which Klopp only changed because of injury issues, ageing midfielders and the midfield revamp, the only really big differences are in the ways Gravenberch, Diaz, Gakpo and Alexander-Arnold are being played.


Beyond personnel they aren't as intense for the full  minutes, they'll almost rest during periods when they're ahead or during the first half and let the opposition tire before killing them off during the nd half. At timesthe buildup is more patient and the team sometimes fall back very deepin posession to draw teams onto them instead of trying to suffocate teams on the edge of their own box. There's possibly more dribbling through midfield but I think that's more of a personnel thing.",1732790642,4,,1,2

Personally I'm not very impressed by how Madrid have acted in the last weeks if I'm a player considering a future there especially on the merit of earning personal accolades from everything around the ownership, PR, management, and performances. 

Nobody is bigger than the club but if he stays he'll be generational. You have to think he knows that and the club does too. We won't hear anything from any of the contracts until we're about to hear from all  of them and that won't happen until the talking stage opens up come the end of December. Anything in the air right now is pure management-driven spin by all parties. 

Madrid needs Trent more than Trent needs Madrid. From his own words around how much more certain victories with clubs mean than to others and how he wants to be a legacy - from being a local young fan sneaking a peak at Gerrard training - it would seem idiotic to leave the current Liverpool for the fire that is Madrid. 

And no, I don't think the Spanish climate means as much to people as it might've  years ago. No, I don't think him being mates with Jude affects things any more than when Liverpool was the apparent target of the aforementioned who was likewise friends with our own Trent. 

These contracts now will be era defining for Trent and probably career summating for Van Dijk and Salah. They will be immense and they will be committal.

No he wasn't. Mbappe already scored more goals than Hazard did during his whole spell at Madrid. It was just like with the turtle right now - everyone saw that he was underperforming but everyone was patient and waited for his redemption arc that never came, because Hazard was a lazy guy who did not care about his body during his career and it was catching him as he aged. 

The injuries he had were a factor also, but every time he was fit the fans believed this has to be his time, and he never delivered. I remember a match vs th league team in the CdR when Hazard was actually unable to dribble defenders, was losing the ball, his movement was slow and predictable. He was a bum at that moment.

Mbapp sucked the entire life out of the team and we progressively got worse. Even with fitter players, such a performance would have doomed us.

He is an excellent player, but not a great all around player (which he doesn't have to be like Ronaldo).

I'm saying a team's form is a fragile ecosystem where changing one thing affects every other player. And throwing Mbappe in there changed the way every other player had to play which adds up to a lot.

Mbappe did have more quieter games in the quarters and semi matches, but even there he wasn't bad. He ended up with  goals and  assists in his  starts before the final, and it's not like he was only scoring tap ins or penalties.

"ok valid, forgot how nasty those two goals against Poland were. 

point is that Mbappe is now struggling in a top league - showcasing that his World Cup performances were perhaps not the best indication of his world class ability: 

- Australia 
- Denmark 
- Poland 

not exactly world class or top level teams. Granted Argentina is, and the world cup final is THEE best stage to do it in. 

look, the anti-Mbappe crowd is likely being hyperbolic here. Mbappe is one of the world's best strikers - perhaps of his generation. we're being super reactionary and harsh because we held Mbappe to such a high standard and he chose to stay at PSG. He's now looking like an absolute flop and it's his own doing.
