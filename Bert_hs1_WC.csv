"Messi is the main character of football. Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become *the* best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in 2014 but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.

He decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.

He finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.

They meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up 2-0 and dominate France for a good 75 minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike 2014 this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.

Messi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...

His teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins *the* trophy.

I think Deschamps got the substitutions right, especially given how much of a nightmare scenario we started out with in the first half...this is sadly the best way it could have ended. Probably the best finale I've ever witnessed.

On another note, I feel like there should be a more serious discussion about pk shootouts, they feel like such a terrible way to decide a victor of a big international game like this. I'm not upset about how we lost, but they lead to these very hollow endings, it neither feels like a win or a loss for France, rather that playing a game of chance.

Anyways, Messi is now undisputed GOAT, no questions there. Mbappe with a worldie of a game himself assuming he gets the golden boot for the competition. I'm proud of France given how everything led up to this point and despite our setbacks I feel we really proved we were still not to be trifled with given our win back in 2018.",1671388811.0,26,:Paris_Saint-Germain:,1,0

MbappÃ© scores two goals in quick guise.  
France fights back with all their might,  
But Argentina won't give up the fight

Extra time is filled with tension,  
As both teams fight for their ascension.  
In the 108th minute, Messi scores again,  
But MbappÃ© equalizes once more to the din

Of this World Cup final match so great.

Messi, definitely the GOAT, there's no more debate of Messi-CR7 rivalry. 

Lautaro, despite having an underwhelming performance throughout the tournament, set up the crucial third goal scored by Messi. Before he was subbed on Argentina was literally overwhelmed with the Spiderman Alvarez lost in French defense. El Toro and Dybala are both fantastic players in Serie A but jinxed in international games (Lauti had a good performance in Copa 2021, but not this year). I hope that they will come back stronger in future tournaments.

Is there any WC tournament that comes close?",1671404764.0,3,:Netherlands:,1,0
"This is simply the most stressful, heart-attack inducing final I have ever seen. 

Argentina had the upper hand of the game for the first 60-70 minutes, with a Messi penalty and a beautifully executed team goal buried by Angel Di Maria (whose presence was sorely missed in the 2014 Final against Germany) put Argentina in front. A series of substitution made by Deschamps (notably Coman and Camavinga) allowed the French to take advantage of errors made by the Argentinian side near the end of the second half and level the game, with Mbappe scoring two goals (the first being a penalty) within a minute or so. The game remained tense during the extra time, with Messi scoring from a rebound and Mbappe equalized with another penalty due to the Argentinian handball. Emi Martinez made a crucial save during the dying minutes of the extra time. During the penalty shootout, Argentina converted all of their shots, while Emi's save against Coman's pen and the miss from Tchouameni guaranteed Argentina's first World Cup win since 1986. The Polish referee, Szymon Marciniak, did a good job today.

Congrats to Argentina for the win, and salute to France for prevailing until the dying minutes to cement this final as an absolutely all-time great showdown - which is a fitting end for a World Cup that has produces quite a few memorable upsets and shockers. Seeing Messi winning the trophy he long dreamed for makes me happy since he was the one who made me fell in love with football (I started watching in 2010), and I can't wait to see what Mbappe does next - he is a next level player.

"It's a shame we'll have the penalty shootout fresh in our minds because that was the best soccer match of my life.  The stakes couldn't have been higher, and the stars shone all the brighter. 

 Messi goes out the GOAT with the last trophy he possibly could win.   He has truly conquered soccer.  

Mbappe had a rough start but ended up with a hat trick, converting a fantastic PK in extra time when the pressure is highest.  He also converted in the shootout - four kicks converted is pressure and he stepped up.  Even though France lose Mbappe is the truth. 

France did not acquit themselves well in the shootout but that is a show of the mental strength of Argentina. To rise up and run after losing to Saudi Arabia is truly the stuff of legends.  

And France will be back.  They say tomorrow ain't guaranteed, and sure they might falter.  But this was France without three of their starters, one of them the Balon D'Or winner in Benzema.  France had to be nerfed to give the other teams a chance.  And beyond that there is young talent like Tchouameni and Camavinga both hungry for minutes and now experienced, having played on the biggest stage under the most pressure.  France will be fine.

It's felt like it's been so difficult for some Argentina players to get booked. They've been dirty and diving at times and got away with it. How on earth Martinez didn't get booked after throwing the ball away during the shootout, any other keeper in the world gets booked there and then. Shouldn't be allowed to be in that situation anyway. Poor sportsmanship but that's been the team the whole time.

It's the just outcome because the new handball rule is inexcusably unjust.

There needs to be some accounting for defenders not having superhuman .1s reaction times to balls shot from close range and for intent and for the fact that moving athletically requires moving your arms about. On the current rule, defenders need to be led-shoed statues for fear of giving up PKs.

"Dear Argentina, long time fan, first time writer:

can you please stop with removing attacking players and trying to play a defensive shell when you have the game by the throat? It didn't work in 2006, or 2010, or 2014, or this year. You just invite world class attacking players to go all out attacking. And guess what? World class attacking players can score when you give them the freedom of the pitch.

Try keeping your attackers on instead. That keeps the opposition defense and midfield on their heels. They have less possession and fewer opportunities to attack and score. Instead, sub in midfielders so you have fresh legs to hound and harry the other guys. Keep pressing, keep attacking, but keep tight. Like the previous 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the match.

Croatia had their big moment in 2018, they should've fucked off this WC. An Argentina-Brazil semi final would've been absolutely legendary. 

The other semi final would've probably also been amazing if Portugal went through. They would've put up a much better fight against France. Morocco was a beautiful fairy tail but a semi final needs to be between the biggest names. Otherwise it doesn't feel like a semi final. Ronaldo's last dance too.

Still probably a top 3 ever WC, a contender for best ever. So much craziness. No one expected this. Everyone expected it to be a shit WC because of the circumstances.",1671391026.0,-5,,1,0
