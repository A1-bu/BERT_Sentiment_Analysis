FIFA World Cup 2022,"Messi is the main character of football. Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become the best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in  but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.

He decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.

He finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.

They meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up - and dominate France for a good  minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike  this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.

Messi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...

His teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins the trophy.

If this isn't the story if the main character of football then I don't know what is.",1,0

I think Deschamps got the substitutions right, especially given how much of a nightmare scenario we started out with in the first half...this is sadly the best way it could have ended. Probably the best finale I've ever witnessed.

On another note, I feel like there should be a more serious discussion about pk shootouts, they feel like such a terrible way to decide a victor of a big international game like this. I'm not upset about how we lost, but they lead to these very hollow endings, it neither feels like a win or a loss for France, rather that playing a game of chance.

Anyways, Messi is now undisputed GOAT, no questions there. Mbappe with a worldie of a game himself assuming he gets the golden boot for the competition.

FIFA World Cup 2022,"This is simply the most stressful, heart-attack inducing final I have ever seen. 

Argentina had the upper hand of the game for the first - minutes, with a Messi penalty and a beautifully executed team goal buried by Angel Di Maria (whose presence was sorely missed in the  Final against Germany) put Argentina in front. A series of substitution made by Deschamps (notably Coman and Camavinga) allowed the French to take advantage of errors made by the Argentinian side near the end of the second half and level the game, with Mbappe scoring two goals (the first being a penalty) within a minute or so. The game remained tense during the extra time, with Messi scoring from a rebound and Mbappe equalized with another penalty due to the Argentinian handball. Emi Martinez made a crucial save during the dying minutes of the extra time. During the penalty shootout, Argentina converted all of their shots, while Emi's save against Coman's pen and the miss from Tchouameni guaranteed Argentina's first World Cup win since . The Polish referee, Szymon Marciniak, did a good job today.

Congrats to Argentina for the win, and salute to France for prevailing until the dying minutes to cement this final as an absolutely all-time great showdown - which is a fitting end for a World Cup that has produces quite a few memorable upsets and shockers. Seeing Messi winning the trophy he long dreamed for makes me happy since he was the one who made me fell in love with football (I started watching in ), and I can't wait to see what Mbappe does next - he is a next level player.

Also everyone was cleared to play on Saturday, which tells me that France were just going to suck it up and have them play to have a chance. Also the fact that they only had  days to prepare for the finals and one of them was a rest/rehab day is definitely a factor especially given the illnesses + few nagging injuries, but that's just the way the luck (or bad luck) of the draw works.

FIFA World Cup 2022,"It's a shame we'll have the penalty shootout fresh in our minds because that was the best soccer match of my life.  The stakes couldn't have been higher, and the stars shone all the brighter. 

 Messi goes out the GOAT with the last trophy he possibly could win.   He has truly conquered soccer.  

Mbappe had a rough start but ended up with a hat trick, converting a fantastic PK in extra time when the pressure is highest.  He also converted in the shootout - four kicks converted is pressure and he stepped up.  Even though France lose Mbappe is the truth. 

France did not acquit themselves well in the shootout but that is a show of the mental strength of Argentina. To rise up and run after losing to Saudi Arabia is truly the stuff of legends.  

And France will be back.  They say tomorrow ain't guaranteed, and sure they might falter.  But this was France without three of their starters, one of them the Balon D'Or winner in Benzema.  France had to be nerfed to give the other teams a chance.  And beyond that there is young talent like Tchouameni and Camavinga both hungry for minutes and now experienced, having played on the biggest stage under the most pressure.  France will be fine. 

Congratulations to Argentina!  What a match!",1,0

It's felt like it's been so difficult for some Argentina players to get booked. They've been dirty and diving at times and got away with it. How on earth Martinez didn't get booked after throwing the ball away during the shootout, any other keeper in the world gets booked there and then. Shouldn't be allowed to be in that situation anyway. Poor sportsmanship but that's been the team the whole time.

France's immediate second goal was amazing and honestly felt like they would get the winner in regulation with how the momentum swung. Argentina got their shit together again in extra time and had another pretty team goal, then gave up another unfortunate penalty. In the end it would've been really harsh if Argentina lost like that, as they were clearly the better team today, in my opinion. Both teams had chances to win it throughout extra time, too.

FIFA World Cup 2022,"I'm so happy to see the just outcome in penalties. 

It's the just outcome because the new handball rule is inexcusably unjust. Attackers can just fire the ball as hard as they can at defenders in the box and if it happens to hit an arm, they get a penalty. There needs to be some accounting for defenders not having superhuman .s reaction times to balls shot from close range and for intent and for the fact that moving athletically requires moving your arms about. On the current rule, defenders need to be led-shoed statues for fear of giving up PKs. 

Getting rid of some subjectivity isn't worth the tremendous unsporting disadvantage defenders play with now. Refs and VAR exist to make judgment calls and they make them all the time. Let them do their job.",1,2

FIFA World Cup 2022,"Dear Argentina, long time fan, first time writer:

can you please stop with removing attacking players and trying to play a defensive shell when you have the game by the throat? It didn't work in , or , or , or this year. You just invite world class attacking players to go all out attacking. And guess what? World class attacking players can score when you give them the freedom of the pitch.

Try keeping your attackers on instead. That keeps the opposition defense and midfield on their heels. They have less possession and fewer opportunities to attack and score. Instead, sub in midfielders so you have fresh legs to hound and harry the other guys. Keep pressing, keep attacking, but keep tight. Like the previous /rds to /ths of the match.

You may have come out on top this time, but it wasn't for lack of trying to lose.",1,0

Cucurella shitting all over Gary Neville's opinion etc.

Foden and Kane, absolutely no impact whatsoever the whole tournament. Southgate, anyone with eyes could see Kane and Foden were doing nothing the whole tournament.

Feel for Watkins and Toney, they must've been watching every single game thinking ""if I was on the pitch I would've at least run in behind a couple times"". Kane looked like he was injured every game, and Foden was just ineffective completely.",1,2

Unreal ball for Cucuarella to hit Oyarzabal and somehow, someway, England had a chance to pull off the impossible AGAIN on that corner late but Simon/Olmo stood tall.

UEFA European Championship 2024,"That was a tough watch as an England fan.  Spain certainly deserved the win not only in this match but for the whole tournament. Would be interesting to see how much better they would be with a capable striker. 

For England, we almost secured yet another sucker-punch but felt Southgate played all his aces in getting the equaliser.  I felt all the players played okay but were just generally outclassed (aside from Kane).  Shout out to Shaw who I think dealt with the threat of Yamal admirably considering the amount of football he has played.  We have a young team with loads of potential - would be great to see what a more forward thinking manager could do with them. 

I also hate the British football media as much as anyone else.  Please don't judge us based on what they say!",1,2

UEFA European Championship 2024,"It's hard to ridicule a manager who made a final, but Southgate's tactics just aren't right for a side like England. Kane looked useless and it's not from poor play but because sitting back on the counter is one of the few things Kane isn't great at. And when they did have the ball they weren't crossing it into him. Any manager who can make Kane look useless needs to be questioned. It's one thing to have a preferred tactic, it's another to force it at the detriment of your world class striker.",1,2

UEFA European Championship 2024,"The better team won but Southgate needs to be sacked tomorrow. He's an utter coward and he's so far out of his depth. No balance on the pitch, parking the bus with just Rice in midfield, playing players who are clearly unfit or past their best, being on top and deciding to play all out of defence. Just absolutely awful decisions front to back, for his entire tenure he's been bailed out by individual brilliance and moments of luck. 

This team under a better manager can actually win something. Get him out.",1,2

You can't always park the bus especially when you have attacking talent,  plus how he uses his tactics when rhey are trailing is also good and have mostly worked in his favor yet they can wait to go all out until they are behind.  Not to mention they just switch off post equalizing.  That's the worst.

A  needs to be able to pass accurately to open up defences, Palmer can do that, Foden doesn't have that incisive pass in his locker. A  should be able to recieve/dribble in tight spaces and shoot well, both players can do that to be fair. But Foden's lack of assertion on a game is concerning. It's all easy when you have a world class Rodri shielding you in the PL and the likes of KDB giving you ball and creating acres of space for you to do some damage.",1,2
UEFA European Championship 2024,Why didn't Southgate throw the kitchen sink at Spain towards the end there? Ya know get whatever you can off the bench and try to draw it? It's not like the Spanish defense was rock solid.,1,2

The coddling of Foden among media and fans is just insane to me. He does the bare minimum and people pretend its the foden we see at City. This is the nation that used to kill Beckham, Rooney and everyone else. It's like they just cant bring themselves to be honest about what he's actually doing on the pitch because they've all prematurely hyped him up as England's best player. 


Sick of this shoehorning in big names at the cost of building the most effective team. You could certainly argue that Kane shouldn't have started this match as well. England did not have their best side on the pitch until at least min+ by their own choice lol.

I just don't get Southgate man, Watkins and Palmer impress whenever they're on the pitch yet he still starts them on the bench? And then whenever we've been on the front foot this tournament we've had success yet, even when we attack an equalise, we immediately go back to sitting deep?

Don't get me wrong we weren't entitled to the win, Spain are class and we could've lost no matter what we did, but I'm just fucking sick to death of Southgate's tactics and decision making. Really hope this is the end for him, he's brought back the positivity and given us some great tournament runs but it's abundantly clear he's not the guy to take us all the way.",1,0

Hes been blessed with a spectacular generation of talent and while others with similar levels have failed in comparison he has shown very little if at all capability of harvesting and growing the pieces he has been dealt.

UEFA European Championship 2024,I've always stood by the fact that Walker's positioning has always been suspect. He's has to take some responsibility for both of Spain's goals. He knows he's quick and often gets away with poor positioning because he can make up the ground with his pace. But the finer margins for both goals were not on his side today.,1,0

Nullified us first half, capitalised on how sluggish we were early second half, didn't let the equaliser rattle them too much. Can't say they don't deserve it based on the whole tournament either.

I don't really want Southgate to leave but i think that might be him done. If we can make Rice, Mainoo, Saka, Bellingham, Palmer, Watkins a thing, though, we've got so much potential.",1,2
UEFA European Championship 2024,"I can't wait for Southgate to be gone. Most talented attacking players England have had in years and the team don't create chances or score goals.

. The best team of the tournament won.

. Gareth Southgate know how to make subs. But I wonder how the game would look if it was Kane coming on fresh at min instead of Watkins. And i wonder what the game would look like if there was a player in front of Luke Shaw on the left. And I wonder how Bellingham played + minutes every single match this tournament.

. Jordan Pickford is a horrible sweeper keeper. And i think the stat for how many times he immediately gave back possession after England finally got it will be shocking. (he had a good match otherwise)

. The ref didn't give England a chance in extra time, ¬Ω minute of players being ""injured"" during extra time and he adds no time for that.

. It was a good final of two very hard working teams. Better than i expected but of course i'd love to see more chances :)",1,0

UEFA European Championship 2024,"I feel like I need to add this, but I got so annoyed at the lack of aerial crosses England made against Spain. Like seriously, Watkins is an aerial threat and could likely win headed shots on goal if they crossed the ball in. I actually was disappointed when Saka or Shaw had the ball on the wings but preferred to pass it back or sideways instead of making a cross into the box. Saka was really tired and needed to be subbed out for Bowen to continue that drive and energy up the right side of the pitch, again baffled that it didn't happen. 


Anyways Fraudgate should be out after this. Foden had a stinker of a tournament and should be replaced by Palmer as he's been far effective in this setup. I loved the chemistry between Watkins and Palmer, hopefully the new manager can see how great they work with each other.",1,0

This has to be the end of Southgate era, England cannot keep playing this fucking type of football anymore under him. It's going to be complete waste of a generation of talent. I will give Southgate credit for bringing in young players when he first got the job and bringing stability to the national team but over time he's getting exposed in many areas on management.

Also Trent being on bench this much in a major tournament not even injured is just a high crime in Football. Especially when Trippier and Shaw have not  played since February.

Gareth's substitutions made sense, they weren't way too late as they often are, and the boys didn't put their heads down once they went behind. It just wasn't enough. This will sting for a while, but for once I don't feel like we handicapped ourselves. Well played to Spain",1,0

The English FA should look for a good head coach outside England. Clearly in England we don't produce a lot of good managers or the wrong people are being promoted into managers. I don't know the reason why, but I hope this addressed at least in the ten years within the English Game.

 - England lost in the final again by getting rawdogged by Spain.  Also England had the easiest opponents known to man and yet underperformed (that along with managerial malpractice) in every game with the exception of the Netherlands.

UEFA European Championship 2024,"I hope Southgate is replaced just so British fans can finally see that their players are generally overrated and not everything is Gareth's fault. You can blame him for lineup selection, and boring tactics, but British pundits overrate a good number of British players because they play their club football with great coaches and non-Brit players that make the game significantly easier for them. 

If Southgate is fired, I would bet any futures that include ""Foden less than . goals at  World Cup"" because Southgate isn't the reason he constantly fills space that isn't there and bogs down so much of England's buildup. Foden is. 

Stones and Walker were good this tournament, but they looked much less confident and coordinated with players like Guehi, Mainoo, Trippier, and Trent next to them than with Rodri and Ake. 

Southgate might be remembered as Roberto Martinez with Belgium for ruining England's ""golden generation"" when I think he should be remembered as a Fernando Santos with Portugal type - a poor manager who got blamed for his team's shortcomings even when they weren't his fault.",1,2

Kane offers nothing other than great finishing, but he has such a limited window of opportunity to get a shot off it's not worth it.

UEFA European Championship 2024,"Seems like not that long ago, Spain was in the same situation that England was kinda. Only one major tournament win that was long ago, and tons of pressure on the team to finally get another in the modern era. 

England has a mountain to climb to ever get over that obstacle. It results in a ton of pressure on the team. But you have to thrive in that situation, you have to want to be the hero and go out and take it. But England couldve been Euro champions twice in a row, but instead are now the only nation to ever lose  Euro finals in a row. 

Thats rough. Hard to be a fan of England. 

But, fuck ya Spain! Love to see it. Wish I could be in Madrid tonight to celebrate.",1,0

England have the same problem as Spain that we both play with the worst option as a striker as a starter. Neither Morata or Kane have shown much in this tournament to deserve such loyalty from their coaches imo.

His entire value rests on being able to catch up with players like Man√©, Williams, Vinicius, Mbappe after they fucking rinse him

He's literally the definition of pace whoring, how the fuck Guardiola gets a tune out of him playing for the most technical passing team

Foden and Saka could be high and go seek champions based on how invisible they were. What was Sakas role? Sit back  feet from goal and do nothing?

Thank you Southgate for getting us there and giving us a chance, time to move on though, there is so much talent in this team, we shouldn't be sitting back as much as we do, that's what cost us the second goal, not sure who the solution is but I don't think it's this.

Having a strong hold up play Striker is massive for us and Solanke does it perfectly. Kulus ability to bring the ball forward and escape a tackle is immense, Sons touch and lay offs were brilliant, and that's probably the best I've seen Madders in a Spurs shirt, goals aside his work ethic today was great, got around the pitch and made himself available and was happy to pitch in defensively. 

The fourth was just an icing on the cake. Werner and Johnson do love setting each other up.

Our forward press is so damn good, with even the midfield duo pushing up into Cities half and just making life difficult. Sarr and Bissouma did their jobs brilliantly. Not often we have games where I can say that no one had a bad game. 

Davies especially really has been the unsung hero of the last  years. Doesn't always play, but when he does he always gives his all, he'll go down as one of our underrated best. 

City wanted Doctor Tottenham, instead we got Doctor Pep with a jab of Cleansheet too. Vicario earned that too, some crucial saves and didn't look out of sorts whatsoever despite a difficult week with Italy.

Kulu is one of the best players in the world right now. His strength and ability to navigate tight spaces is just insane. Biss is also in the best sustained form that we've seen since his transfer - absolutely elite at winning the ball back and staying composed. 

Madders - come get your flowers. When he's on, he is the creative force we lacked for so long. 

Dragon - wow does he look so much better on the right side. Pairing him with Gentle Ben also works well given Ben's versatility and overall composure as a player. Do we think about pairing Dragon and Micky for stretches going forward?

It has taken a while to come to fruition, and there have been bumps along the road, but Ange knows this is the only way.

Some of the football we played was unbelievable especially in the first half. Not many teams (if any) go to City and play like that. Thought it was a good sign that we stepped off in the second half and managed the game, even at two nil where it's always risky.

Match : EPL Away win Vs Man city. (notes taken during match). City unbeaten at home for  games. Back from a horrible int break we have lost our  cbs to injury. In their place are Ben Davis and Dragusin. Bentacur starts  match ban. Bookies have us at \ to win. Biss on a yellow card within  seconds. City total domination first  mins. But Madders scores from a simply super cross from kulu (started on rw) on our first serious counter-attack.  mins later Madders does it again! Masterful assist from sonny. It was a gvardiol def error that allowed it. Several fingertip saves from City GK and some vgood saves from Vic ended a very nice first half.

nd half: We came out nice and calm, a nice goal by Porro set up superbly by the fantastic Kulu\Solanke and Sonny combo, amazing, we are - up! The heavens open with torrential rain to celebrate!! When Spurs play like this you can watch them all day and night, it's beautiful. If its going to go wrong it will start now i suspect ( mins) but we are in control, city no shots on goal so far in this half. on m Son off for BJ, seems sensible enough, BJ takes left wing. We are making the champions look very ordinary today. Commentator: "" This is how good Spurs can be!"". Vic has made a string of excellent saves here. Subs Timo and BJ (back at rw) score on mins to make it -. A spurs masterclass. Every single player did his bit. MOTM Kulu. Happy birthday Madders.",0,1

[Orsenfelt ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Orsenfelt/)‚Ä¢ [y ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/dun/comment/jnvez/)‚Ä¢

As a Celtic fan I can predict pretty much exactly the process - because we all went through it. We were told by fans of his previous clubs it'll happen, happened to them and we didn't believe it either. Then it happened.

It will depend on who your first  fixtures are. If the season starts away at like a Man City then you're going to think the guy has lost his marbles because he'll line you up like --- or something, players all over the place, he's screaming from the sideline because your rightback didn't make the strikers run off the last defender and you'll think this isn't attacking football it's just sprint at the ball childrens stuff.

And yeah, you lose that game quite handily and it will look shit because City are really good and they aren't going to be phased by a team just disjointedly pressing them they'll carve you open. It'll be that for a couple of games, not everyone is a ManCity win some lose some. He'll try every player in the books, he'll banish a player you really like to the shadow realm and stubbornly keep playing somebody you think can't cut it.

Then you'll play I don't know.. Bournemouth and absolutely smash them. Not a ""Oh yeah it worked today because they were shite"" win, not a nice easy - stroll in the sunshine - a jesus christ stop they're already dead sort of win. Begging for a rest, just a touch of the ball that doesn't have  midfielders on me immediately

You feel it coming in the games before, you see the pieces starting to click and you think yeah bit more of this and it'll work. Then it really works. That is the moment you fall in love with Angeball, you think fuck yes I want to watch that every week.

Then you do it to a good team and that seals it. Just regular punters in the stands want to run through walls for the guy.",0,1

Which means either Kulu on the wing (not my fav) or moving more into the --- type formation we saw today that Ange isn't super inclined to.

To win the title, you have to play a dominating style against the very best.

No one, in  games, has done that to City.

Even our rivals down the road, a long way advanced in their development, still go there and park the bus.

This result shows how advanced we are with our mentality. 

It shows we are not far off real success.

Ange wants to win the title. Being dogmatic like this is the only way to do it. Teams who don't dominate possession no longer win the Premier League. Leicester we're the last one. There will be pain until it clicks but that is the only way a team learns to play in this way.

City are such an incredible team, - down at home, there will always be a response, hence any stat differential you are amazingly putting down to pragmatism. They keep possession better than any team that's existed.

The team got this win by playing with courage at the champions.

Pretty much every team, including our rivals, go there for a draw.

Because Ange has dogmatically insisted our team plays the same way regardless of opponents, we are able to go there, take them on, and smash them at home.

This result is something that happens due to Ange's dogmatic insistence on playing a certain style regardless of opponent.

At some point we gotta judge him by what he's been showing us for a while now and not by what he was at his peak.

Konate is the big concern. Pray it's not as bad as it seems and it's just an awkward twist/knocking of knees that hasn't done any damage. Would be a big miss.

I would have been happy with a draw as well. The squad is so imbalanced thanks to injuries and Mbappe still not fully clicking.

Now people seem to have realised in match thread comments how crucial Vini is for the squad. He can change the game he wants. He has that flair, ambition everything else about the game.

Sulking, feeling sorry for himself. Vinicius on his worst days always tries to put the team on his shoulders, causes some bust-up with the opponent for no reason and insults the ref's entire line because he didn't get an easy foul. 

Mbapp is just there. Loses the ball when he tries to dribble, misplaces a pass and causes a great counter by Liverpool time and time again. Vazquez, Ceballos and Fran Garc√≠a came on with more balls to try and turn the game around than Mbapp has shown in the past few months.

I've always thought it wrong for the fanbase to revere a player who has achieved nothing yet for Real Madrid and had only played the club like a fiddle in the past few years. Now you reap what you sow. No balls to sub him off. He has to play every game, and at least  minutes. Welcome to Mbapp FC. Truly the worst timeline. He won  Champions Leagues before coming here, and if he was the one leading us we'd win  while he's here. Thank god we have Vinicius.",1,2

Guler is very young and raw, he needs to improve a lot, and while there weren't better choices, I don't think a player like him should start at Anfield. Brahim is just not a striker, what the fuck was Carlo thinking playing him striker?

Mbappe is just void of confidence. He's geniuenly mentally not there. I'm not saying this as a insult but it's clear on his face that he is more afraid of doing a mistake than he is happy if it turns out okay. That penalty was also just sad to see.

. Liverpool has fast and strong centerbacks to neutralize Mbappe's pace.

Contest a loose ball? Not my problem.

A teammate makes a good run forward? It ain't me so why pass?

Don't get me wrong, Mbappe is one of the most talented players I've seen but I have watched/played football for many years, thousands of hours, and I cannot remember a worse professional player in my life. For the simple fact, that, he doesn't want to play football.

Champions League 2024,"i mean arda and brahim had a pretty bad game too but if mbappe's name was anything but mbappe he would've come out instead of arda. he did every thing wrong today, shit performance all around",1,2
Champions League 2024,"When are we going to get mendy, courtois call out mbappe for being so shit and give us a ‚Äúon my momma he is playing against us"". 

Esa mierda tiene que ir al castilla truly a liability having him on the field he is so bad the rest of the team won't pass the ball because he won't do shit with or worst lose the ball and being the diva he is he won't track back. 

Was a cancer at psg, currently a cancer with the national team and by how things are going to far things are not going to be good for him here.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Maybe Madrid needs another Winger guys,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Why is every single one of madrid's players a dirty prick (except camavinga)

Hope bradley and konate are ok",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Endrick finishing the game with a dirtier kit in  min than Mbappe in  min is exactly what is wrong with Mbappe, have not seen him do the extra step or run the extra mile for the badge this entire season, always standing around waiting for a pass to take a  on  with the defender (and fail without exception) was his entire game today",1,2
Champions League 2024,Get absolutely fucked Madrid,1,2
Champions League 2024,"What a win for Liverpool. Lost their keeper, lost their best attacker, lost the best RB in works football and still beat RM minus Vini. Fair play to Liverpool.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Mbappe to now focus on the National Team, lol",1,2
Champions League 2024,Don Carlo? Don Arne,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Being honest, I genuinely expected the turtle to perform in his preferred position.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Fair play to Asencio, looked good for his second start",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He was shit but there's some headloss with Mbappe ‚Äòwhy's he not coming off?' Like it was clear Ancelotti wanted to look to hit us on the break and the best chance of that is with gambling on him.

Jones has took a step again this season. Injuries really held him back as he's always had it in him to be a really solid midfielder for us. He's had that confidence from the start.

Also Madrid being where they are in a super league lite is very funny considering Perez is begging for the real one still.",1,2
Champions League 2024,I presume real will be doubling down their efforts to sign liverpools best rb in jan (connor bradley).,1,2
Champions League 2024,Completely deserved win from Liverpool. Real Madrid should consider themselves lucky it wasn't by  or ,1,2

Champions League 2024,"Who doesn't love seeing Madrid humbled. 

Schadenfreude",1,2
Champions League 2024,Vinicius getting injured so the world can see how shite Mbappe is regardless of position is reason enough to give him the Ballon D'or. I.Q off the charts.,1,2

Champions League 2024,Another Mbarrassing performance,1,2

Champions League 2024,mbappe legit looking washed,1,2
Champions League 2024,I know the discourse around arda has become toxic somewhat but it is crazy that he was the first to go in this game. He made some glaring mistakes in passing was despite that he was one of the better players on madrid's side. modric mbappe and bellingham should have been taken out way before he was,1,2
Champions League 2024,Expected more from Madrid.,1,2

We look unstoppable at the moment, yet we keep getting told ‚Äòyour big test is your next game'. Kelleher out here casually smashing football like it's nothing. LOVE IT arneeeeee slotttttttttt",1,2
Champions League 2024,Just seen Bellinghams interview after the game. He comes of as very mature. Easy to forget he's  only. Really like him,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Bellingham is soo overrated.

I only say that because I keep hearing how he is a generational player, will be a Madrid great etc..I just don't see it.

He is a moments player and I stand by that. He will come up with an goal or an assist like in the Euro's but he doesn't dominate a game from start to finish imo, which is what generational players do. Look at how Iniesta used to control and dominate games. 

I actually think Camavinga was far better and more influential before he went off with an injury.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Real needs some serious rebuild, the youngsters are not that great, the stars are failing expectations too often. Not sure why Trent would even consider playing there",1,2
Champions League 2024,Seeing so many parallels between Messi's first season at PSG and Mbapp's first at Real Madrid.,1,2
Champions League 2024,It's been  years since mbappe peaked. He is not that guy anymore. The next hazard is here.,1,2

Champions League 2024,can they sack Ancelotti already? madrid looked like everton out there tonight,1,2
Champions League 2024,"No offense to Liverpool they were fantastic today but honestly without Vini plus our already awful season, it seems like we will get destroyed by any decent team",1,2

Champions League 2024,Tbf they're both quietly underrated,1,2

Champions League 2024,Same as always. He won them the  CL final. Feels good to see them finally crumble.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He is still the best keeper in the World thanks God because it would have been ugly (well even more) , also Kelleher is as good as i heard, kinda a rich man problems for Liverpool in the future",1,2

Champions League 2024,I'll never forgive Real if they ruin him,1,2
Champions League 2024,Easily the worst game I've ever seen him have.  Hard to believe it's the same guy that carried France to a WC final,1,2
Champions League 2024,He was surprisingly quick for a guy who had Mbappe in his pocket,1,2
Champions League 2024,He's the right sided Andy Robertson,1,2
Champions League 2024,"monster performance, MOTM for me",1,2
Champions League 2024,Crazy amount of crowd noise on the broadcast. The crowds really turned up since the Chelsea/Brighton game this season.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Absolutely need that again on Sunday. Arguably an even bigger game for us,1,2
Champions League 2024,That Bradley tackle certainly lift them up even more,1,2
Champions League 2024,Not often commentators are drowned out by the crowd. All I heard every now and then was McCoist's excitable babble,1,2

Champions League 2024,"Honestly, after this season it seems criminal to sell Kelleher",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Couldn't agree more. Kelleher is world class.

Last time I said that I got downvoted becausehow could Liverpool's backup keeper be world class? But watch his performance this season and tell me he isn't. I'd be very happy to see him as our first goal keeper, because the best player in the world took a penalty against him today and I felt confident that he'd save it. 

Not really sure what more he has to do to get the respect he deserves. We've not lost a game this season with him in net.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Mamardashvili is willing to sit behind Ali until he's done while kelleher has been vocal about wanting to go be the man somewhere (rightfully) for the past couple years

That's the only reason it's happening like this. Kelleher is tits and everyone at LFC knows it. Will always be a fan pretty much wherever he goes",1,2
Champions League 2024,"At this point there should be serious discussions about whether it's worth cashing in on an injury prone Ali, have kweev as st choice for a year or two and then bed Mama in.   It will never happen because Ali is a god, but it should be discussed...",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Honestly, Alisson is still the better keeper but not by much with how Kelleher keeps showing game after gsme. I love them both but i wouldnt be surprised kf they cashed in on Alisson this summer instead of letting him go on a free next year, and let kelleher/mamardashvillo fight for the keeper position. What a problem to have tho. Would be nice having an irish tho ngl",1,2
Champions League 2024,He can wait. Kelleher deserves the spot after ali,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He was kinda like this in Brazil as well, at least in the sense of being a pretty violent player.


No idea why he was specifically trying to take Konate out tho, that's new to me. Usually he just hits players who are fouling or tauting him.",1,2

Champions League 2024,I think Bradley's got the talent to be one of the best in the world if he keeps at it. He's good v (not perfect but he doesn't need to be) and he's a good attacking threat along with good dribbling,1,2

Even if he didn't have mental issues or whatever and his performances were top level, how would you fit him in the squad? He's not a CF and he doesn't want to play on the right.

Champions League 2024,"Mbappe hasn't looked great for a while, even with France in the euros. But I think Madrid looks like they're really missing Kroos. I think a new manager with shake everything up a bit and come up with a new system that can work with their stacked squad",1,2

Champions League 2024,"I will forever die on this hill. Hate watching Madrid last season was horrible because you just knew that he'd come on and score the scrappiest of goals. His perfomance vs bayern was the perfect example. He really personified last season's Madrid team perfectly. Not the prettiest, but never out of the game.",1,2

Fucking shocker",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He has done two times befire and the ref only gave him a yellow wine it was too late, I hope we play them again so konate can flatten the fucker",1,2
Champions League 2024,I think a lot of bad feeling towards Madrid stems from Ramos's behaviour in the  CL final where he very cynically injured Salah and did a number on Karius. That is c&ntish behavior,1,2
Champions League 2024,And how is Real Madrid evil here? Because you are a hater?,1,2
Champions League 2024,They are getting drawn against Arsenal in that th to th vs th to th qualifier round and the sub is going to get shut down. Mark my words.,1,2

Champions League 2024,Bellingham was right though. He was unfairly scapegoated after the EUROs when anyone with eyes could've seen how much he brought to that England  team. And he had enough perspective to admit that he was feeling sorry for himself also. Can't really fault him for his attitude at being unfairly targeted,1,2
Champions League 2024,"lol way to shit on men's mental health. Jude was very mature about it, the media was extra much after him. Money isn't everything.

But the award thing was weird. Because why did the official ceremony have memes of Vini? definitely more to the story than has been told",1,2

Champions League 2024,"It's so lovely seeing how absolutely certain they are that we will drop points and at the same time assume they won't drop, like, any more at all for the rest of the season. Their depth is somehow even weaker than last season and they are incredibly dependent on Saka and √òdegaard. Sure we got Arsenal and City to play away, but that's at most  points lost, at this point even two losses there has us as favorites to go all the way.",1,2

Thanks, just described every madrid game this season",1,2
Champions League 2024,Haven't played anyone above them in either the Premier or Champions League. % easy fixtures. Long may it continue.,1,2
Champions League 2024,This is the game that I'll now admit than you guys are the real deal to be fair.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"I don't watch him that regularly, but any time I've seen him the last  months, this is the type of performance I've seen.

Personally, I think it's all mental.  I think the nonsense at PSG and constantly worrying about money and nonsense has resulted in him just losing complete focus on what's needed to be a footballer.  If you look at players like Ronaldo or Messi, they had A+ professionalism.  Mbappe has always struggled with it, but now it's gotten really bad.

Big picture, Madrid supporters have to hope the next coach can get him focused again.  If they somehow bring Zidane back, I think that's a real possibility.  Not sure any other coach can do it.",1,2
Champions League 2024,It's always tough when you're up against the best right back in the business Conor Bradley,1,2
Champions League 2024,"His confidence is shot and the pressure is getting to him. 

His speed can't bail him out of the heavy and inaccurate touches. And because he's overthinking things, his touches are increasingly heavy and inaccurate. 

Watch his penalty. Before the whistle, he doesn't look at the ball. He doesn't look at the keeper, but to the side, presumably at the ref for the whistle. That's a nervous attitude, a lack of concentration. 

He needs to rediscover his strengths and work on his focus. Not sure he'll have the luxury of time at Madrid though",1,2
Champions League 2024,Eh. He's fit. His pace has recently returned. He's just not dribbling because he doesn't think he beat Liverpool's defenders and opt for passes instead.,1,2
Champions League 2024,He has been looking like that for months now,1,2
Champions League 2024,What players have looked any good against this Liverpool team this year?,1,2
Champions League 2024,Factos,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Genuinely don't think he was that horrible, just poor overall offense on the team.. he seemed to dribble well. Also had a terrible penalty which eclipses everything else.",1,2

Champions League 2024,ONly because Endrick was throwing himself at Ibous legs the whole time the dirty little cunt.,1,2

Champions League 2024,Endrick is a cunt. Dude is stealing wages and just being a goon.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"I mean I am a Liverpool fan, but Madrid is really not just minus Vini. Cama went out injured, Carvajal, Alaba, Militao, Tchou, Rodrigo, Vini and I'm pretty sure I've dropped about a  more names on their injury list",1,2
Champions League 2024,He was one of the better players because Liverpool weren't afraid of him and let him roam free.,1,2
Champions League 2024,You haven't watched them this year then,1,2

Champions League 2024,PR comment about the goat of PR,1,2
Champions League 2024,He's a cunt,1,2
Champions League 2024,He is good but this season he's not playing in a position that allows him to score goals. He's been picking up the slack of Mbappe and Vini defensively.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"As a Barca fan I can tell you didnt watch Iniesta play when he was .  Bellingham is pretty fucking Young man , give him a break .

He was way better last year when he didnt have to do Kroos job too",1,2
Champions League 2024,He's worth half a jones,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He was alright, he has to do all the hard work with lazy gits like Mbappe in the team.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Tell u what, buy a time machine, go back to last year, and follow him through all the season  (not only CL and euros, but the league as well) and tell me how is he overrated? He was dominating most of the games he played, he dipped at the end but only because he was playing with an injury. He was awarded the MVP of the league and with good reason. This season he's been playing a different role, I wish he could go back, but he's still a machine. Absolutely not overrated.",1,2
Champions League 2024,It's insane you typing this he was BY FAR AND AWAY our best player and it's not even close,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Bellingham would be a generational player in another team that plays like a team.

This Real Madrid team is full of stars, the attention always shifts to those players instead of a workhorse like Bellingham, he'll never be noticed the right way nor appreciated.",1,2
Champions League 2024,I get your point but he's so sooo young. Probably not wise to call his career on what we've seen thus far,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Bellingham is good if you play him in his position as an .
Not a  or a .",1,2
Champions League 2024,It looks like they need to fill about  other positions before getting a right back like Trent,1,2

Champions League 2024,Liverpool is Fraudbappe father,1,2
Champions League 2024,Ali has a pretty poor pen record so maybe not. But there's literally  doubt who the better keeper and starter is lol,1,2
Champions League 2024,"considering he's very good at pens and it was a shit one - probably

but you cannot deny how good Kelleher is. He should be first choice keeper for a CL team

 mil plus Matt Turner",1,2

Champions League 2024, men?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"We were missing our  star players in Rodrygo and Vini plus our defense is in shambles. We played well, but Liverpool is on top of their game. It went as expected. I don't think it would've been as one sided if we were at full strength. We did learn that Mbappe is not Madrid quality and I'm not sure if he ever will be after this game.",1,2
Champions League 2024,This is you with Mbappe bro,1,2
Champions League 2024,We gonna act like mbappe signing was not supposed to be enough?,1,2
Champions League 2024,It's not your life. Nobody gives a shit about you.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"I mean if any team deserves something from the City being shit, it is Liverpool. We have suffered a lot of agony with this City machine. 

You guys have done well but you have only suffered twice (really only last season).",1,2

Champions League 2024,Real Madrid were the ones with No offense yesterday tho..,1,2
Champions League 2024,Vini was there for the - whoopin,1,2
Champions League 2024,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

RM got Mbappe and it threw a wrench in the squad and everyone's roles changed a bit to accommodate Mbappe and Vini playing at the same time.",1,2
Champions League 2024,I don't know what you watched lol he was busy but crap,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yes?

Haland/ronaldo/messi/whoever you want missed pens, every player misses pens",1,2
Champions League 2024,Who won the pen?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"No, that single missed penalty has changed our opinions entirely. He's just an  season wonder. Bin him off.",1,2

Champions League 2024,John Henry liked this,1,2

Champions League 2024,Rent free,1,2
Champions League 2024,Anyone actually say that?,1,2
Champions League 2024,Zzz,1,2
Champions League 2024,Look Arsenal fans have been on another one lately seeing as they thought it would be them capitalizing on a City down year but there's not really much basis to say Slot is better than Arteta yet. What Arteta has done with Arsenal is the sign of a great manager. The question remains if he's the one to get them over the line or not,1,2
Champions League 2024,Insane take,1,2
Champions League 2024,Yeah the guy that won  CL's is overrated. Reactionary statements like this scream of low intelligence.,1,2

Champions League 2024,Lol u have no injury crisis.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Lmao,1,2
Champions League 2024,"friendly reminder our first choice keeper (arguably best in the world) and cf are out injured at the moment, as well as our starting rb (maybe the best in the world, although he is on the bench)",1,2
Champions League 2024,Just like when Arsenal beat Liverpool last season.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Liverpool have had Alisson, Jota and Trent out injured for periods, as well as Elliott, Tsimikas and others. I know Arsenal fans think only they get injuries, but do some research",1,2
Champions League 2024,Always an arsenal fan crying in the corner. Liverpool also have injuries but that doesn't fit your narrative,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Lmao this is the new Arsenal cope:
- Liverpool haven't played any good
- Liverpool haven't played anyone good when they're fit
- Liverpool haven't played anyone good away from home
- Liverpool haven't played anyone good while Arteta plays YNWA over the speakers at Arsenal's training ground",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Let's not act like Alison, Trent, Jota, Elliot and Chiesa are all injured.",1,2
Champions League 2024,what‚Äòs the next excuse going to be for you?,1,2

Champions League 2024,Cry me a river. We've got a higher chance on winning it this season than Los Francos. You lot just focus on making it through to the RO.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"You're rattled as hell lil bro. Madrid beat Liverpool in the knockouts when they had no CB's and the other time dead midfield. They've not played Liverpool when they're good except the finals which they were dominated in especially ,  Ratmos did what he did.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"By ""acting like UCL winners"" you mean efficiently beating one of the top rated sides in Europe who spend ridiculous amounts of money on players?",1,2
Champions League 2024,Wtf? Jones and Macca were bossing that midfield.,1,2
Champions League 2024, shutup man,1,2
Champions League 2024,Hahahahha,1,2
Champions League 2024,Be lovely to welcome you guys at Anfield again to show you our lack of midfield in person.,1,2

Champions League 2024,The amount of PL bias in this sub is crazy lol,1,2
Champions League 2024,Bellingham was the only attacker for us tonight,1,2
Champions League 2024,Bellingham was good today. Covered a lot of ground and was a presence in both defence and offence. He is like  players on the pitch.,1,2

Champions League 2024,Perez will die before he sells Mbappe. Never gonna happen unfortunately,1,2
Champions League 2024,,1,2
Champions League 2024,Always hate it when we're playing against him. It's almost like we create a lot more chances for them to be saved,1,2
Champions League 2024,nd best keeper on the pitch tonight,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Let's just pray they get eliminated so we don't need to face him again, he hates us as much as we hate him.",1,2
Champions League 2024,x,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Don't know why Real Madrid didn't just employ the same tactics as that night. Ref was lenient, I reckon they could have assaulted  Liverpool players without issue.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He's ' with an enormous wingspan. It's so much easier for him to cover ground than the average keeper, there's no way there isn't an added psychological impact for players playing against him, knowing they have to be inch perfect to beat him.",1,2
Champions League 2024,That's just his normal performance. He's rarely flashy but he's pretty much flawless every game and has been bailing out Madrid for years,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He's such a massive prospect, Connor.",1,2
Champions League 2024,his generation did bring back cargo pants,1,2
Champions League 2024,No issue at all for the nd best RB in the world,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Madrid's head is turned. No contract to Trent after all, they're sending a  figure offer Liverpool's way for Bradley.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Loved his performance.,1,2
Champions League 2024,In fairness I'm barely over that and I was a neutral.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Way before that. He only performed in the final,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Mbapp is giving dyslexia to Madrid fans, that's how bad he is",1,2

Champions League 2024,the Barcelona hate watch went so crazy tonight,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Don't bother with people like them, I give it two weeks and they'll sing the same song again. Guler is talented but he's very weak and is not ready.",1,2
Champions League 2024,the Guler PR is insane. There are weekly reports from Madrid accounts about him scoring golazos in training lmao,1,2
Champions League 2024,Yamal is a threat. Guler is a warm body who makes sideways passes.,1,2
Champions League 2024,He has barely played and he has looked good in every game except this game.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"honestly yea, I just wish he'd press and at least work on other areas of his game when maybe the shooting or attacking isn't falling, but he'll just run at  defenders and try dribble around them when he should be passing more, or he'll drill a pass at the attacker when it should be floated, he just doesn't seem to think during the game

Mbappe seems to be in his own head now and it's affecting him, I don't think Ancelotti's tactics have helped, but now that Vini is out there's no excuse for him not to step up, especially in his natural position slightly left",1,2
Champions League 2024,At least PSG will know that he'll light up the farmers league when they buy him.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Ligue  is casually strolling in the UCL this year,1,2
Champions League 2024,"> Fraudappe 

now this is / material",1,2

The entire team is trying to help him as best as they can but he has only been sliding further and further. Even when he came here, he wasn't there but there were certainly signs of promise. Today, he literally didn't do single thing right. Literally. I challenge everyone to point out even  bright moment from him tonight. Misplaced simple  years passes as well. [Sadly it's been a theme.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/gyyscs/comment/lyvqgkn) Today there neither Vini, nor Rodrygo and this was his what performance or the season.

Champions League 2024,"Slot's style suits him better, maybe even Gravenberch too. We're more tight in the middle and our backline is more secure which allows players like Curtis to play their game, even when they lose the ball we got others close enough to cover.

Klopp's ball is more open so we can't afford our midfielders expressing themselves in our own half, which was why Wijnaldum, Fabinho, Henderson were so effective because they just play it simple.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Lad is the embodiment of the scouse ego.
Carrying himself like he is the best player on the pitch. Absolutely love it.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"It is a lot more patient and less frenetic than it was with Klopp. Some elements like counter attacks from opponent set-pieces are still there, but much more patient with the ball. Not forcing it as much around the opponents box. More willing to take low percentage shots from time to time.

Where Klopp would be frustrated by low block teams not wanting to engage, Slot is perfectly happy to keep the ball and build pressure through possession.

One of the big differences between the previous and current version is under Klopp, we would crank up the pressure after scoring to try and get a second quickly. They don't do that as much under Slot, which makes it feel more like a tightrope walk, but the stats show we are actually conceding less chances and xG this season, so it is more solid.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Bit of both.

The basic foundations are there (counter pressing, being direct) but slot has different implementations of the same ideas.

Klopp almost exclusively played --, slot is more flexible and he plays a flexible --- that shifts between a -- or -- depending on phase of play. The overall play is less aggressive, more control, but also more solid defensively. The full backs are less influential in his system, but the wingers are more influential and asked to do more. 

You could say he was lucky to inherit the right caliber of players who already have a general idea of how to play his system, but he's also been very effective in tweaking to suit the players he has and communicating what he wants and implementing it. 

One thing that is evident about slot vs klopp is that he is much more flexible tactically, and I even think his game management is better. There have been  or  games already where his side starts slow, he takes the first half to figure out what the other side is doing, then makes big changes at half time and turns the game around. He isn't against ugly and pragmatic tactics.

It isnt all rosy though, the team does look vulnerable if you have a team capable of playing through your press and he's been quite reliant on a few players.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Latter. Slowed the game and put more emphasis on possession, control, and recycling the ball instead of springing counters. Kind of still feasting on the attacking movements Klopp coached as many goals still come from either counters or set pieces, but he's given the team control over games which was at times lacking last year",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He's tweaked things here and there but not much more than that, the style is very similar to the way the team played in the - and - seasons, which Klopp only changed because of injury issues, ageing midfielders and the midfield revamp, the only really big differences are in the ways Gravenberch, Diaz, Gakpo and Alexander-Arnold are being played.


Beyond personnel they aren't as intense for the full  minutes, they'll almost rest during periods when they're ahead or during the first half and let the opposition tire before killing them off during the nd half. At timesthe buildup is more patient and the team sometimes fall back very deepin posession to draw teams onto them instead of trying to suffocate teams on the edge of their own box. There's possibly more dribbling through midfield but I think that's more of a personnel thing.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"We knew he would be amazing as he has never been anything else, this man is an absolute legend.

And to be honest, there isn't a better club in the world for him to go to after us 

You'll never walk alone",1,2
Champions League 2024,"We'll live if that's the case. 

Personally I'm not very impressed by how Madrid have acted in the last weeks if I'm a player considering a future there especially on the merit of earning personal accolades from everything around the ownership, PR, management, and performances. 

Nobody is bigger than the club but if he stays he'll be generational. You have to think he knows that and the club does too. We won't hear anything from any of the contracts until we're about to hear from all  of them and that won't happen until the talking stage opens up come the end of December. Anything in the air right now is pure management-driven spin by all parties. 

Madrid needs Trent more than Trent needs Madrid. From his own words around how much more certain victories with clubs mean than to others and how he wants to be a legacy - from being a local young fan sneaking a peak at Gerrard training - it would seem idiotic to leave the current Liverpool for the fire that is Madrid. 

And no, I don't think the Spanish climate means as much to people as it might've  years ago. No, I don't think him being mates with Jude affects things any more than when Liverpool was the apparent target of the aforementioned who was likewise friends with our own Trent. 

These contracts now will be era defining for Trent and probably career summating for Van Dijk and Salah. They will be immense and they will be committal. 

No way we lose / of these guys, and I'd be surprised if we lost . But in a year or two, we'll need to have prepared because that time will come quickly.",1,2

No he wasn't. Mbappe already scored more goals than Hazard did during his whole spell at Madrid. It was just like with the turtle right now - everyone saw that he was underperforming but everyone was patient and waited for his redemption arc that never came, because Hazard was a lazy guy who did not care about his body during his career and it was catching him as he aged. 

The injuries he had were a factor also, but every time he was fit the fans believed this has to be his time, and he never delivered. I remember a match vs th league team in the CdR when Hazard was actually unable to dribble defenders, was losing the ball, his movement was slow and predictable. He was a bum at that moment.

So he may be out of form but Bradley cannot provide what Trent brings to the table attacking wise. Just see the Arsenal equalizer to know why.

Just to be clear I dont want Carlo sacked, but knowing how Madrid operate he wont stay long there with these results. Even that bit of interview that made it here with him telling the journo he knows best... thats the sort of reaction a man under stress will give.  Doesn't bode well IMO.",1,2

It's in these moments he needs to show his worth, and he doesn't. He can % be blamed for failing and held responsible.

If the penalty miss is the only negative you gather from today, then you haven't watched the game. Subbing a player who is visibly not in great shape, nor playing good, shouldn't be a statement. But the club, and not just the staff, feels like it would be because there's something very very wrong with the dynamic between Mbapp and his role in the team.",1,2

What more does Kelleher have to do to be ?",1,2

Champions League 2024,I've just seen about  minutes of him and I hate the cunt. I think I've seen enough.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Like you have lmao,1,2
Champions League 2024,They control the narrative in the media so it's easy to get away with it,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yah totally. Barca are the good guys. They consider a player who has bitten others multiple occasions, a defender who sold out for money, Vidal, and Arajo who rugby tackles players.

Not to mention they worship Gavi who can't go a single minute without fouling someone. Lol.


Loads of players everywhere who play dirty for every team. But only Madrid have them because we all hate Madrid. Am I right",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yeah, that's the reason they are heroes and not their lenghty careers at the club during which they were fantastic defenders and won tons of trophies.


Nope.",1,2
Champions League 2024,What? Projecting much?,1,2
Champions League 2024,Just like ascensio's goal line clearance. Bro is proving to be insane,1,2
Champions League 2024,That's been the feature of our season so far. Pretty decent in the first half but huge improvements in the second. It's Slot's specialty according to Feyenoord fans and we're seeing it here,1,2
Champions League 2024,It was mostly tactical. In the first half Liverpool essentially kept Bradley and Robertson tucked in. In the second half they pushed up high and wide and Madrid couldn't keep up.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Whenever the game is - at the half, Slot is gonna cook something up. We rarely score in the first half with this tram",1,2
Champions League 2024,"They manage to pace themselves so well, it's really impressive. Instead of pressing % until they get tired and in trouble late game, Slot has them slow the game down at times, get control and then get pressing again.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Maybe he told them you guys are shit and they deserve to win.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Crazy how many promising counter situations he wasted, genuinely / performance from Mbappe",1,2
Champions League 2024,"No idea what youre on about, bradley and kelleher are the best keeper/rb in the world",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Literally this.

I feel like people forget about Liverpool's injuries because of how good the backups have been.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Our backups are injured too. Literally our reserves are injured too. Castilla itself in an injury crisis, struggling to field a team so as not to give a bye. Ascensio is our third choice centre back, from the academy. 

Having said that, I agree with you that this can't be an excuse. Most of all, none of this has no bearing on Arda's but most of all, Kylian's performance. 

Mbapp sucked the entire life out of the team and we progressively got worse. Even with fitter players, such a performance would have doomed us. 

Plus, history books don't care. Liverpool beats Madrid and deserves all the credit. I just wanted to provide context of just how dire the injury situation at Madrid is. It's infinitely worse than Bar√ßa, which is some statement.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Worth remembering than Elliott was set to be the Szoboszlai back up going into the season, and he hasn't played, despite Szobo not staring either. We're also missing arguably our better left back based on this seasons form.",1,2
Champions League 2024,From Bellingham taking the pen,1,2
Champions League 2024,"If someone else than Mbappe took the penalty.

Literally why the fuck is totally out of form player with huge pressure to perform taking a penalty in away CL game at Anfield of all places?",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Parisian, sure of Algerian/Cameroonian origin but he is pretty much as French as you can get and I really doubt he speaks Arabic fluently",1,2
Champions League 2024,If he sorts his passing out I'll take him in my  a side.,1,2
Champions League 2024,That's right,1,2
Champions League 2024,He's been on Chelsea's shortlist for many years,1,2

Champions League 2024,Yeah u guys have like - gks and then bought another excellent one tbh ,1,2
Champions League 2024,m thx bohley,1,2
Champions League 2024,Feel like a lot Chelsea fans actually know he's good because of those  or  finals lmao. Wouldn't want to sell him to you because he's actually really really good lol,1,2
Champions League 2024,I wouldn't want to lose him but he wants to move on and he deserves to go and be a starting keeper plus we have Mamardashvili coming in next year who's also really good,1,2
Champions League 2024,Spurs needs a keeper too. Look out for a January bidding war.,1,2
Champions League 2024,I think he still has some question marks because he's a backup and hasn't had a full season yet so I can't see Chelsea going for him but I think he'd be great for you.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Bro is still stuck in the commobol mindset lmao.,1,2

Champions League 2024,"Two fouls and people are acting like he tried to murder somebody. Two fouls which didn't cause any injuries. 

Konate got injured because both him and Van Dijk closed down Endrick, who was the only one actually chasing the ball btw, and caused him to fall on Konate. It sucks, but it's the nature of the game. They went looking for physical contact, not the other way around.",1,2

Champions League 2024,"With how he is playing, the only thing he would be able to sell is toilet paper with his face on it.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"I mean he didn't get his popularity for nothing. He's been huge for PSG, France and Monaco when he was there. Sure Ligue  is easier to be good in than other leagues, but he was heads over anyone else there for the majority of his tenure. He probably needs a different system and the tactics to be made around him to be at his best, which imo downplays his ¬´best in the world¬ª status, but being a system player doesn't mean you're not necessarily world class",1,2

Maybe another manager with a different set of skills can get % Vini and % Mbappe at the same time which would still be devastating but I just can't see it happening where both are catered to completely.",1,2

Champions League 2024,"I mean, this is the kind of stuff I'd expect a world class defense to figure out BEFORE the game. Sure, having R√ºdiger cover VVD on corners is on itself a sensible move - but not if it means leaving a ,m tall striker to be covered by the second shortest LM in the sport.

Champions League 2024,"Sure, but also they are tainted with requiring such a high level of results that Mbappe won't be able to deliver it.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Sure, but it's not like Liverpool are some second rate club. Real Madrids in a tier of its own, Liverpools in the next tier down with Bayern and Barca.",1,2
Champions League 2024,For now,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Bellingham is of course a phenomenal player, best in his position and would be an upgrade over Szobo. But every time I hear him talk I like him less. It doesn't impact his play, but he's got a massive ego and says the stupidest shit. I dunno, I'd take his ability but I'm glad to to deal with his fragile ego. At least Szobo keeps his head down and works % for us.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"I think the assessment is completely skewed  though, Trent's defensive performance has been constantly held up by both the system and whoever plays right center back. One of the reasons Konate took Quansahs spot (not saying Quansah should have kept it anyway) is because the responsibility to cover a ridiculous amount of ground and win physical duels because of Trent is much higher than whoever plays on the left side. It's because of Trent. People just look at the fact the team as a whole is better defensively and conceding less chances and thinks that means Trent has magically just improved defensively this season.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yeah weird cause even Liverpool supporters can admit that Trent needs to be babysat for Liverpool, it's a part of the reason why Quansah lost his spot because when you play on the right side of Liverpools central defense you have to cover a much bigger amount of territory when Trent is playing vs on the left side.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"realistically, you could lose two of those",1,2

Champions League 2024,"I wouldn't call it a hammering per se, but it was a dominant performance for sure. We were the better team throughout.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Kroos is retired. Liverpool didn't have Gerrard, Dalglish, Rush.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"We didn't have Jota, Trent, and Alisson.  mainstays. There's no A team these days so you chill.",1,2
Champions League 2024,You do know that kroos retired right?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Liverpool were missing just as many important starters, not that vini or Rodrigo would've made a difference anyway.",1,2

Liverpool beat Real Madrid. The real Madrid.",1,2
Champions League 2024,So? That's not Liverpool's fault. It's still three points,1,2
Champions League 2024,"B team hahahahahahaha, wonder how much that B team costs",1,2
Champions League 2024,"That was a slight factor, but most of that is that his purple patch simply ended. Expecting him to score  goals in  games or whatever continuously was a delusional r/soccer thing, he doesn't have the characteristics or the skillset for that. He continued to have the same role as the physical central threat in the area, he just had less luck. If there was any tactical way to unlock the form he had in those first  games of the season, Ancelotti would opt for that because those were absurd numbers - but there isn't. An extremely lucky patch can't be reproduced.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Uh... Did you forget your own argument?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"We're also just a much, much better team with Odegaard. Now he's back, and with a relatively kind schedule, I think (hope) we should make up some ground by January.",1,2
Champions League 2024,You have a more than capable replacement..,1,2
Champions League 2024,Yeah. I meant for RM.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Ah my bad.,1,2
Champions League 2024,May be experiencing an existential dilemma,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Obviously I think Allison has been the best keeper (top  with Courtois maybe) in the world the last couple of years, but he's been injured a lot. Do we let Kelleher walk just for Ali to get hurt again next year and hope Gio is as good as Kelleher when Kelleher is ready right now?

Would be a difficult decision and one I think they are unlikely to make, but Kelleher has been top class this year.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"That's fair. I'm just worried we are going to let the next great keeper go somewhere else while Allison struggles for fitness.

In fairness it's largely probably recency bias. Just sucks to lose a player who has been so good for us.",1,2
Champions League 2024,A bid is a bid. You missed out on the American spider.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He's a better shot stopper than McCarthy. Ederson's obviously not on the level of Allison or Courtouis as a shot stopper, but he's average at worst (and significantly less likely to pass to the opposition than Macca). Although, given his performance yesterday it may well be Ortega in goal at the weekend.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Please lower your voice when Nunez is fit,1,2
Champions League 2024,He's more of a Gabigol,1,2
Champions League 2024,"And that's just about the only thing he did. Subbed on, played for  mins and only made a single pass before getting booked",1,2
Champions League 2024,"With the last play of the game and no hope of winning too. I was finally starting to forget his injury history, I hope he's ok he's been spectacular this season.",1,2
Champions League 2024,That move wasn't looking good at all. It didn't even look like he tried avoiding contact with Konate when falling down. Made my blood boil a little,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Who cares, it's a weird group stage match with significant injuries set backs. Let's see how the playoffs turn out. Also, I'm not a RM fan, I just watch them because I like top tier club football.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Didn't deserve it lol. But Euros gonna racist.,1,2
Champions League 2024,The mark of a world class player is that they make those around them look better and he certainly does that,1,2
Champions League 2024,Did nothing but roll around and kick players,1,2
Champions League 2024,Gyokeres is overrated,1,2
Champions League 2024,This was a great performance form him but he hasn't been as good as last season.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Absolutely, he will play the football that suits the players he's got. With that team, that was the result. I've just never really associated him with a style or philosophy. He's good enough to adapt to what he has.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Well at least Carlo is used to that,  every single year there are multiple news he's finished and definilty sacked but he survived let's see.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"There is % they do not qualify (  is the last place for qualify i think), so Vini will be back",1,2

He is an excellent player, but not a great all around player (which he doesn't have to be like Ronaldo).

I'm saying a team's form is a fragile ecosystem where changing one thing affects every other player. And throwing Mbappe in there changed the way every other player had to play which adds up to a lot.

Last season, you always sensed that RM was going to come back from behind out of nowhere (and they did). This season, you just don't have that feeling anymore.",1,2

Champions League 2024,"To be fair Slot has been given a far easier job than Arteta. He's got a premade squad full of world class winners, he's hardly revamped them he's just kept them on the same path

I think with the squad Arteta started with, not a single player would get in that Liverpool team, maybe one or two would sneak on the bench

Not to say Slot hasn't done well so far but it's such a different scenario",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Oh slot and arteta totally inherited the same quality of squad, righttt.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Klopp needed a few seasons to really get his team and vision in place. Same with Ferguson at Utd. Slot arrived at a club that had a very well established and settled squad, a lot of whom had won big trophies in recent years",1,2
Champions League 2024,Slot has CL winning/PL winning players .Arteta had to pay Ozil and Aubameyang to fuck off .,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Slot was handed a very good squad with a consistent ethos. Liverpool had a plan before he arrived.

Arteta has done a rebuild. He didn't inherit any of the current starters except for Saka.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"I know right, coming second  seasons in a row isn't good enough we should be winning everything, regardless that we aren't the best team in the league let alone the best in the world. Honestly mate, you are one of the reasons why arsenal has such a bad rep.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Barca flair coming in clutch I seriously don't know the hate carlo gets. Even from rm fans not only other clubs,1,2
Champions League 2024,Love it,1,2
Champions League 2024,yeah you must've watched something else entirely...,1,2
Champions League 2024,In what world was this a impressive performance from Liverpool?,1,2
Champions League 2024,This is what happens when you use too much social media,1,2
Champions League 2024,"I'm not old enough to be around in those times and I grew up on rap and grime but I started off listening to the wellerman when it was popping up everywhere and this eventually led me to a bunch of Irish music, come out ye blacks and tans is a banger! I don't care for the political implications it's just a banger, and go on home British soldiers go on home. I'm British but it's great!",1,2
Champions League 2024,"You'll find one or two. Plus you'll find anarchists, communists and a fair few theocrats. Like anywhere, everyone is different and not everyone believes in the idea of a republic.",1,2
Champions League 2024,I bet there are two or three weirdos in there still,1,2
Champions League 2024,Kelleher is the second best keeper in the world,1,2
Champions League 2024,Lol force benching? He probably force plays him,1,2
Champions League 2024,th. Jaros was on the bench.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Don't feed that narrative. Need a m Saudi bid for Vinicius to finally unlock Mboopi at left wing,1,2
Champions League 2024,"we got two yellows for our midfielders early, if he didnt give those it would have been equal for both sides, but yeah after these yellows the ref was fine",1,2
Champions League 2024,it is literally fools circlejerking.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Trent was on the bench. If he's fit enough on Sunday, he'd start.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"You could see him say something like ""i think its my harmstring"" 
Good sign was that after the game he moved pretty normally so hopefully nothing too serious",1,2
Champions League 2024,Needs that Copa del Rey to complete the set,1,2
Champions League 2024,What? Who is that meant to be?,1,2
Champions League 2024,i think he was actually one when he started playing,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Always hate when Bojan gets brought up in these conversations because he started his senior career in Barcelona incredibly well and justified the hype behind him, it was only as the seasons went on and the mental health issues became more apparent that he started slowing down and stopped performing",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yeah, also doesnt help that there wasnt any presence in the box because Brahim diaz was playing as a striker.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"There is UCL class, and then there is this Liverpool. They are in top form and any team would be in trouble against them",1,2
Champions League 2024,Yeah well I only saw him in the Euros and he was often the most impressive player on the pitch..,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Lol what? The first goal against England was a screamer from Tchouameni, Mbappe wasn't even really involved in the play",1,2
Champions League 2024,And he assisted both goals against Morocco.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Absolutely, just a shame the stakes weren't higher",1,2
Champions League 2024,"> But last year Kelleher played more than him

He didn't (Ali played  to Queev's ), also bunch of Kelleher's games were in Europa League when Alisson was fit, we just gave them to Kelleher.  
  
> What more does Kelleher have to do to be ?  
  
Be the best in the world, like Alisson Becker. Simple.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Probably shoot Allison.


He won't be no.  with him there. It'll be sad to see him go.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Truth is with Alisson we kept pace with Chelsea's record breaking season for conceded goals. He's just different class. Really, really unfair to Kelleher and Mamardashvili, who are at a very similar level from what I've seen. Shot stopping wise, we really don't know if Mama is any good with his feet due to the teams he plays for.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Chelsea was in a similar position with Cech and Courtois. They had to sell Cech to make way for the snake.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"can't argue with that, yeah

in old Klopp's system what I was referring to was more meaningful",1,2
Champions League 2024,Fair enough lol,1,2
Champions League 2024,SP flair lol,1,2
Champions League 2024,Like I have what? I never said anything about him.. if anything your statement is to my point hah,1,2
Champions League 2024,True tbh. Glad some non la liga fans are also getting a taste of what these guys are actually are.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Kid looked good tbh. Thought he could of maybe had a little more of a challenge on Mac's shot but impressive everywhere else,1,2
Champions League 2024,Ascensiolooks a gem of a player regardless of the circumstances which he has found himself playing.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"It's ridiculous how many clubs are going through some kind of injury crisis atm. The calendar is unsustainable and yet FIFA and UEFA will just keep pointing the finger at each other and saying ""it's their fault"".",1,2
Champions League 2024,Fair,1,2
Champions League 2024,How generous of you.,1,2
Champions League 2024,He actually joined us at  but he went back to Southampton for personal reasons. Supposedly a Chelsea fan though,1,2
Champions League 2024,"For all of our depth issues around the pitch these last years, we've been really spoiled for keepers as of late and spoiled incredible moments by those keepers",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Super hot take that I can't believe I've been thinking, but maybe it would be better for the team to let Ali go, Caoimh√≠n is just going to keep getting better without being so injury prone. And yes Alisson is still incredible, but also incredibly consistent in missing crucial time every single season, but can still be sold great, and Caoimh√≠n is younger, with less wages and minimal drop in quality at this point.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Rather keep keeev, sell Mama, and it sounds crazy but make Ali fight for starter",1,2
Champions League 2024,Vicario's off to somewhere?,1,2
Champions League 2024,Clown comment,1,2
Champions League 2024,So you're just fixated on young brazilian strikers?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"And in those  minutes he managed to kick an Alaves player in the balls, injured Konate and was dirty all around. Also let me remind you of the match against Uruguay in Copa America and his time in Brazil overall but I guess it doesn't matter as you seem to defend him all over the thread and you're beyond biased",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He's not a bad player by any means of course but he was good in a historically weak league and for his country, which is impressive, but there's many players that are great for country and bad in clubs or vice-versa, like James Rodriguez or Vini Jr. 

I'm just saying very overrated. Not that he's not good, but that in my opinion he has never, not even for a moment, been the best player in the world.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Bros like the only thing keeping Man U frkm conceeding even more goals than they have, true saviour for this year ngl",1,2
Champions League 2024,"When he came in I thought he's shite for a really long time, but he really changed my mind recently. Dude is pretty good. If united had an truely ""average"" keeper in their box they would be even further down in the mud lol.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Wild isn't it! I really hadn't realised how bad it had gotten,1,2
Champions League 2024,City to score first,1,2
Champions League 2024,And don't call me Shirley.,1,2
Champions League 2024,And don't call me Shirley!,1,2
Champions League 2024,And strengthen Chelsea? No thanks,1,2
Champions League 2024,Chelsea wouldnt pay  for him prior to buying sanchez,1,2
Champions League 2024,No worries was just adding on yo your comment lol.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Endrick and G√ºler have shown more flashes of brilliance than Mbappe this season. None of the attackers played well today, still think G√ºler and Brahim were better than Mbappe tho. 

Mbappe have been shit for + games now. Does he need to be shit for  more for him to be benched?",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Besides Bellingham and Rudi, we are thin in tall players (currently available)",1,2
Champions League 2024,I think they were surprised by the quick corner,1,2
Champions League 2024,,1,2
Champions League 2024,I agree.  They don't even have an Audi Cup.  I mean...,1,2
Champions League 2024,"i just put it down to tribalism tbh, even as a Liverpool fan i like to think i can be objective about stuff but a lot of fans seem to interpret _any_ criticism of their team, players or manager as a personal attack or something.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"I can live with  points, that should be enough imo",1,2
Champions League 2024,Brest are th right now. They've been decent.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Salzburg, yes but Brest can be slippery.",1,2
Champions League 2024,I mean if there is any player that could be called a system its Kroos.,1,2
Champions League 2024,,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Reasons for losing this season: Kroos, next season will be Modric, season after Carvajal or something",1,2
Champions League 2024,Hahaha,1,2
Champions League 2024,"If only Liverpool still had Dalglish playing for us, we'd have battered them - instead ",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Vini and Rodrygo are obviously game changers, cut the crap.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Liverpool were missing  starters?,1,2
Champions League 2024,Who better be going to Chelsea next year ,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Worse, you're an Endrick fan LMAO.",1,2
Champions League 2024,You're actually mental.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"If you like top tier club football you should've tuned in last weekend, Southampton actually put on a show",1,2
Champions League 2024,"You liked the dross and crap they put out tonight?
 You must love football hahaha",1,2
Champions League 2024,Lol sounds like a pretty bigoted comment there though,1,2
Champions League 2024,"That's been his style of play for years tbh, even in Brazil he was like that",1,2
Champions League 2024,Without getting punished for it. Least you'll only have to survive it every other year in Europe whereas La liga teams need to accept he can knee opponents in the nuts without issue.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Perfect type of striker that would bang in goals against yall tho,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Nah, have you seen one game from him??",1,2
Champions League 2024,Honestly I doubt he will be he's expected to be out for a while.,1,2
Champions League 2024,I don't follow Real but I've heard he normally plays centre forward because Vini's better on the wing,1,2
Champions League 2024,Remember Konchesky? He was the worst player I've ever seen play for Liverpool but I'm not a Liverpool fan so there may have been worse.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Also neymar was affected by injuries he had a great first season in psg till he got Hurt,  same with the second and third season.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Looking at this performance i hate that i cant disagree, without vini we are so shit, so it kinda depends on how in form vini will be when he returns",1,2
Champions League 2024,"You don't play with RW, RB and a RWB all on at the same time lmao. We're also missing our first choice ST.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Mo is having one of the most productive years of his entire career. He is showing no signs of declining.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"TAA would stay if the money is right. Mo while older bow deserves a contract from us for all he has done. Seriously, he has elevated Liverpool and helped us win the League pay him",1,2
Champions League 2024,Sorry you got down voted. I thought your comment was entirely fair and kind.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yes I know about that, but as always they are under investigation and we cannot act like someone is guilty until proven guilty.",1,2
Champions League 2024,tbh no reason I just don't like him,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Real Madrid fans have no moral highground to stand on and pretend that any other fanbase is somehow worse than them. You're the most deluded, entitled, unbearable and arrogant fanbase in the entirety of the internet. Shut the fuck up for once.",1,2
Champions League 2024,The fact that fans of other clubs in here are agreeing with Liverpool fans it might be the Real fans who are unreal,1,2
Champions League 2024,if you say so!,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yeah, it's interesting to watch the two opinions battle it out.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He did come out and defend them, it's stupid, but that's nowhere near as bad as rape.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Where are they now?,1,2
Champions League 2024,I can't hear you from the bottom of the table,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yeah. Rivalry doesn't mean there can't be kind words, compassion or peace between the fans of two opposing teams.",1,2
Champions League 2024,In reality missing Carvajal and Kroos is all the difference along with not being able to bring in Modric as a sub instead of starting.,1,2
Champions League 2024,England got to the final but not because of him. One over head kick doesn't mean the rest of his play was good. The amount the media gas him up is actually ridiculous. Being English does that I guess,1,2
Champions League 2024,"I never said he was having a bad season, I just said I do not believe he is a generational player like many claim him to be.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yeah same to you guys, big fan of Torres back in the day and love Klopp so much too, hope you go on to do great things! Been blown away by how good Slot has done as a new manager, have to give credit where it's due!",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Well given the Salah earns k and Havertz earns k and our wage bill and spending is probably much higher over the past years , no excuse for us to have a good enough squad by now.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Tbf I'm Italian so I have pride for him. But yeah people are gonna be reactionary. Still an insane take tho. No way you beat peak city / years just out of luck.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"excellent defensively (Konate, Bradley very good), no real lapses in concentration, controlled it for  mins, created great chances and should've scored more, scored a couple lovely goals. Not our best of the season by any means but big CL night and a good performance is still enough to be happy about.

Or sorry was that the dreaded PL bias showing",1,2
Champions League 2024,Kelleher is the nd best keeper in the world,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Maybe th, Lunin's actually pretty good",1,2
Champions League 2024,Trent,1,2
Champions League 2024,"True, an unsaveable headed goal against Australia,  go-ahead goals against Denmark, one of which was a particularly awful one-two with Theo. He was so bad he was benched for the third group match.

In what may have been his shittiest game yet in that cup, he got the ball to Giroud in the box for the first goal in the knockout match against Poland, and then scored two top corner goals to seal the win.

Mbappe did have more quieter games in the quarters and semi matches, but even there he wasn't bad. He ended up with  goals and  assists in his  starts before the final, and it's not like he was only scoring tap ins or penalties. Griezmann was the better player until the final, but anyone who wants to pretend that he somehow waited till the game against Argentina to play well is absolutely not worth taking seriously",1,2
Champions League 2024,"did you watch the game or just the highlights

he didn't assist or anything but the reason the ball was so high up the pitch was because he progressed it during a transition",1,2
Champions League 2024,"What is he missing then?      
He defends them close and from a far, defends PKs and honestly is no Neuer when it comes to feet, but is that what he needs to beat Alisson?",1,2
Champions League 2024,"> Allison

Allison? How...? You're a Liverpool fan.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Obviously you saw enough of him to know he wasn't dirty huh,1,2
Champions League 2024,I mean what I said is factually true so get off my back,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yup, man was so frustrated by Nunez",1,2
Champions League 2024,"He would have been the positive in last weeks if it was not for the scandal, which ruins it for me.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Well don't say that just yet. 

I said if.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Apparently he was homesick,1,2
Champions League 2024,Yeah but I think liv have decent depth not as bad as a few other teams,1,2
Champions League 2024,And I'm sure they'd get a pretty hefty fee for Alisson that they could use to sign other players.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Slot was quite clear that Allison is solidly the . He's perhaps our best ever keeper.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Kelleher is so good but Ali is just a level above him and Kelleher also only has  year on his contract no way is he extending,1,2
Champions League 2024,just got a long injury,1,2
Champions League 2024,Brilliant argument,1,2
Champions League 2024,"No, I just don't think he fell on Konate on purpose. Is that so hard to believe?",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Alaves player deserved it. I'm not biased, I actually watched his games, not just clips, like you here.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Very sensible and I agree tbf,1,2
Champions League 2024,#NAME?,1,2
Champions League 2024,I think his stock has risen since then and it continues to rise,1,2
Champions League 2024,"The answer might genuinely be yes lmao.

Ancelotti is like that sometimes.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Tinpots,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Idk if brests defense can hold up against a fully healthy madrid attack , but we'll just have to see",1,2
Champions League 2024,Not our fault Real Madrid doesn't have the depth. Poorly run club with unlimited pull and money.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He mentioned  players and one of them is retired. That was my reference point. Not to mention that it's pointless anyway, as everyone in the world knew liverpool is a much better team this season and would've been clear favourites even if both teams were perfectly fit.",1,2
Champions League 2024,They buying a new island off the coast to store all the keepers?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Ofc I am, he won us a title.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Why? People here acting all smug and moralistic at the same time. You people are really weird.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"I don't care to watch the shitters of Europe, sorry. Florentino should've gotten Euro League going already.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"It's RM vs Liverpool, ofc I'm gonna watch the game. Now, RM played poorly, it happens. People acting so smug here, wtf. This is way beyond banter, you people have problems. Lol.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Yep, cry reverse racism, it's what racists do.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Doing it in Portugal is different than doing it in bigger leagues

Also it might just be me but his game looks quite raw for a  year old",1,2
Champions League 2024,The group stage finish in late january. News said he will miss  weeks,1,2
Champions League 2024,he played LW on the weekend and against Liverpool,1,2
Champions League 2024,"As I said, doing fuck all. Excluding his own sister.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Isn't Darwin Nunez you st choice ST?,1,2
Champions League 2024,My grandma always said downvotes build character so it's all good,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Greenwood was never ""proven guilty"" should we not call him out for being a rapist? 

Asensio may or may not be found guilty but there's a fair bit of proof to what he did, it's known that he distributed the video, they've got the group chat, so I'm going to keep calling him a nonce.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Yes we can,1,2
Champions League 2024,I can respect that as an answer.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Thanks,1,2
Champions League 2024,LMAO,1,2
Champions League 2024,"NO ONE SAYS THIS ENOUGH, THANK YOU!!

The game against city last season  was just so good. I would not say he outclassed pep, but his tactics for the night were incredible. I was so scared whenever city had the ball but the defensive game by us. Dani made one mistake that night & kdb rammed the ball in but other than it was a perfect game",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Excellent defensively vs Brahim Diaz, Guler and Mbappe of today is not difficult. Go ahead.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Kelleher is the nd best keeper in the world,1,2
Champions League 2024,"th, Taffarel was in the building too",1,2
Champions League 2024,I was confused because I was thinking carvajal is out for the season lol.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"ok valid, forgot how nasty those two goals against Poland were. 

point is that Mbappe is now struggling in a top league - showcasing that his World Cup performances were perhaps not the best indication of his world class ability: 

- Australia 
- Denmark 
- Poland 

not exactly world class or top level teams. Granted Argentina is, and the world cup final is THEE best stage to do it in. 

look, the anti-Mbappe crowd is likely being hyperbolic here. Mbappe is one of the world's best strikers - perhaps of his generation. we're being super reactionary and harsh because we held Mbappe to such a high standard and he chose to stay at PSG. He's now looking like an absolute flop and it's his own doing.

his legacy will be less rose tinted if he doesn't turn up at Real Madrid or another top level league. that's the price for being legendary.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Okay but it's incredibly common to have possession of the ball deep into the opponents half, bit of a stretch to give him credit for the goal when it was mainly individual brilliance for the strike",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Ali is a better shot stopper, sweeper keeper, and better with distribution",1,2
Champions League 2024,Being able to spell isn't one of the qualifications for supporting a football club.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Did I?,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Ok so I'm not nuts to think this lol. I really do love Alisson and we're lucky to have him, but I think longterm it's riskier to keep him and to let Caoimh√≠n go, and we're certainly going to need the money if more than one of Mo, Trent and Virg walk for free.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"I know, and my argument is not at all a matter of skill, my argument is about fitness and the fact that he struggles with the same thigh injury every single season. And the fact while Caoimh√≠n is not an upgrade, but also not a downgrade and keeps getting better the more minutes he gets, I really think losing him for a lot less money than Ali would be a mistake.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"I know spouting bs, very excited to finally beat RM",1,2
Champions League 2024,"No argument, everyone could see what he is at. Another shit, overhyped player who can't handle other players or teams being better than him.",1,2
Champions League 2024,We even lost the Bangkok Centenary Trophy to man united two summers ago ,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Never said it was Liverpool's fault, you all played well even while battling your own injuries. But it's laughable to say Vini and Rodrygo would've been non factors had they played, like what are we doing here?",1,2
Champions League 2024,Damn I've been baited,1,2
Champions League 2024,"It's only justified anger, chill. Obviously a Liverpool fan is gonna be angry that Endrick comes on, fouls Konate twice and makes no attempt to play properly at all. Plays dirty asf and injures him in the dying embers of the game. Would you not be just as mad if that was done to him when he was still at Palmeiras?",1,2
Champions League 2024,"Don't bother trust me. Reason, logic and grounded thinking isn't a strong point in these subs and especially matchday threads.",1,2
Champions League 2024,You're the one crying though. Guess when you worship big babies you become one yourself. Tell yer ma you need to suck her titties and leave us all alone,1,2
Champions League 2024,Yeah but with Barcas voodoo in UCL I wouldn't doubt Sporting would make a match against yall entertaining,1,2
Champions League 2024,Hattrick against city and a decent match from HIM against arsenal,1,2
Champions League 2024,Well then I've read some bollocks,1,2

Champions League 2024,Good day to you.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Kelleher is the nd best keeper in the world.,1,2
Champions League 2024,"Mbappe also regularly tore up the UCL. Australia, Denmark and Poland are not the top teams but they aren't minnows either, they are regular major tournament participants.

He genuinely was world class. But he is indeed on an extremely sharp decline and I agree that he's at serious risk of ending up being thought of as an elite world cup player √† la Klose who peaked early and flamed out. Staying at PSG was a major L and it was ultimately self-inflicted, since that decision he's done nothing but get lazier on the field while also losing confidence.",1,2
Champions League 2024,"i'm just going against the claim that he ""wasn't impactful."" obviously tchouameni gets basically all the credit",1,2
Champions League 2024,I think he could do with putting some size on too he doesn't seem as commanding on crosses as Ali,1,2
Champions League 2024,"So when Darwin Nunez threw a chair at opposing fans after a loss, what was that?",1,2
Champions League 2024,"The Yellow foul I agree was dirty, IMO should be a red that type of foul, but the last play I remember as being an attempt to play the ball. I am chill btw, people in here are the hiveminded weirdos. 
Also, Liverpool fans trying to clown on RM with their matchup history is ridiculous LOL, real short memories here.",1,2
Champions League 2024,Riiiiiiiiiiiiight. I'm the one. LOL. Vini >>> Liverpool. Byeeeeee,1,2
Champions League 2024,Without Amorim? I'm skeptical.,1,2
Champions League 2024,He will still miss others - games so its still a lot.,1,2
Champions League 2024,Atleast you guys have your wingers and Darwin is not bad tbh. But in our both vini and rodrygo is injured and this fking turtle can't do anything for God's sake ,1,2
Champions League 2024,"He admitted to sharing child porn, it's not really an accusation. Nor has it ruined his life lol he's still playing for Real Madrid like nothing happened",1,2
