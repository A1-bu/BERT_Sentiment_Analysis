FIFA World Cup 2022,"Messi is the main character of football. Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become the best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in  but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.

He decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.

He finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.

They meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up - and dominate France for a good  minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike  this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.

Messi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...

His teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins the trophy.

If this isn't the story if the main character of football then I don't know what is.",22,27

I think Deschamps got the substitutions right, especially given how much of a nightmare scenario we started out with in the first half...this is sadly the best way it could have ended. Probably the best finale I've ever witnessed.

On another note, I feel like there should be a more serious discussion about pk shootouts, they feel like such a terrible way to decide a victor of a big international game like this. I'm not upset about how we lost, but they lead to these very hollow endings, it neither feels like a win or a loss for France, rather that playing a game of chance.

Anyways, Messi is now undisputed GOAT, no questions there. Mbappe with a worldie of a game himself assuming he gets the golden boot for the competition. I'm proud of France given how everything led up to this point and despite our setbacks I feel we really proved we were still not to be trifled with given our win back in .",25,22

Before he was subbed on Argentina was literally overwhelmed with the Spiderman Alvarez lost in French defense. El Toro and Dybala are both fantastic players in Serie A but jinxed in international games (Lauti had a good performance in Copa , but not this year).

FIFA World Cup 2022,"This is simply the most stressful, heart-attack inducing final I have ever seen. 

Argentina had the upper hand of the game for the first - minutes, with a Messi penalty and a beautifully executed team goal buried by Angel Di Maria (whose presence was sorely missed in the  Final against Germany) put Argentina in front. A series of substitution made by Deschamps (notably Coman and Camavinga) allowed the French to take advantage of errors made by the Argentinian side near the end of the second half and level the game, with Mbappe scoring two goals (the first being a penalty) within a minute or so. The game remained tense during the extra time, with Messi scoring from a rebound and Mbappe equalized with another penalty due to the Argentinian handball. Emi Martinez made a crucial save during the dying minutes of the extra time. During the penalty shootout, Argentina converted all of their shots, while Emi's save against Coman's pen and the miss from Tchouameni guaranteed Argentina's first World Cup win since . The Polish referee, Szymon Marciniak, did a good job today.

Congrats to Argentina for the win, and salute to France for prevailing until the dying minutes to cement this final as an absolutely all-time great showdown - which is a fitting end for a World Cup that has produces quite a few memorable upsets and shockers. Seeing Messi winning the trophy he long dreamed for makes me happy since he was the one who made me fell in love with football (I started watching in ), and I can't wait to see what Mbappe does next - he is a next level player.

I really think the virus was a problem and my suspicion was that a few more players contracted it in the past few days but they didn't reveal it as those guys were the ones that had to star. Also everyone was cleared to play on Saturday, which tells me that France were just going to suck it up and have them play to have a chance. Also the fact that they only had  days to prepare for the finals and one of them was a rest/rehab day is definitely a factor especially given the illnesses + few nagging injuries, but that's just the way the luck (or bad luck) of the draw works.

FIFA World Cup 2022,"It's a shame we'll have the penalty shootout fresh in our minds because that was the best soccer match of my life.  The stakes couldn't have been higher, and the stars shone all the brighter. 

 Messi goes out the GOAT with the last trophy he possibly could win.   He has truly conquered soccer.  

Mbappe had a rough start but ended up with a hat trick, converting a fantastic PK in extra time when the pressure is highest.  He also converted in the shootout - four kicks converted is pressure and he stepped up.  Even though France lose Mbappe is the truth. 

France did not acquit themselves well in the shootout but that is a show of the mental strength of Argentina. To rise up and run after losing to Saudi Arabia is truly the stuff of legends.  

And France will be back.  They say tomorrow ain't guaranteed, and sure they might falter.  But this was France without three of their starters, one of them the Balon D'Or winner in Benzema.  France had to be nerfed to give the other teams a chance.  And beyond that there is young talent like Tchouameni and Camavinga both hungry for minutes and now experienced, having played on the biggest stage under the most pressure.  France will be fine. 

Congratulations to Argentina!  What a match!",0,20

It's felt like it's been so difficult for some Argentina players to get booked. They've been dirty and diving at times and got away with it. How on earth Martinez didn't get booked after throwing the ball away during the shootout, any other keeper in the world gets booked there and then. Shouldn't be allowed to be in that situation anyway. Poor sportsmanship but that's been the team the whole time.

It's the just outcome because the new handball rule is inexcusably unjust.

There needs to be some accounting for defenders not having superhuman .s reaction times to balls shot from close range and for intent and for the fact that moving athletically requires moving your arms about. On the current rule, defenders need to be led-shoed statues for fear of giving up PKs.

can you please stop with removing attacking players and trying to play a defensive shell when you have the game by the throat? It didn't work in , or , or , or this year. You just invite world class attacking players to go all out attacking. And guess what? World class attacking players can score when you give them the freedom of the pitch.

Try keeping your attackers on instead. That keeps the opposition defense and midfield on their heels. They have less possession and fewer opportunities to attack and score. Instead, sub in midfielders so you have fresh legs to hound and harry the other guys. Keep pressing, keep attacking, but keep tight. Like the previous /rds to /ths of the match.

You may have come out on top this time, but it wasn't for lack of trying to lose.",27,7

He plays Foden, Bellingham & Saka, that only makes sense if you plan to dominate the ball in the opponents half and play a really high line. 

I have no problem with sitting deep and trying to hit Spain on the break but fuck me surely you would play Watkins and/or Gordon with Kane. Spain just pushed up because they know Kane and Foden won't run past them.",3,27

But it has to be the last tournament for Kane and Southgate. Whatever was left of Kane's legs have gone (we'll no doubt find out he's been carrying an injury and playing through) and he doesn't work as part of a counter attacking team. 

Southgate has worked wonders with this squad over the last few years and obviously got us to a semi final and two finals, but we need someone who is willing to make bolder decisions quicker to push this team forward. Kane should have been hooked sooner (shouldn't have started tbf), and we should have made more subs once we scored as Spain were out on their feet at that point.",0,22

Shocking string of performances from the likes of Kane, Foden, Bellingham and I'd even argue Rice yet not a chance of them getting dropped despite signs of immediate improvement when changes have been made. This has been Southgateball  to me from day one and I don't think he should be getting nearly the level of respect he has gotten from the British media. 

Hes been blessed with a spectacular generation of talent and while others with similar levels have failed in comparison he has shown very little if at all capability of harvesting and growing the pieces he has been dealt.

. The best team of the tournament won.

. Gareth Southgate know how to make subs. But I wonder how the game would look if it was Kane coming on fresh at min instead of Watkins. And i wonder what the game would look like if there was a player in front of Luke Shaw on the left. And I wonder how Bellingham played + minutes every single match this tournament.

. Jordan Pickford is a horrible sweeper keeper. And i think the stat for how many times he immediately gave back possession after England finally got it will be shocking. (he had a good match otherwise)

. The ref didn't give England a chance in extra time, ¬Ω minute of players being ""injured"" during extra time and he adds no time for that.

. It was a good final of two very hard working teams. Better than i expected but of course i'd love to see more chances :)",0,26

Saka was really tired and needed to be subbed out for Bowen to continue that drive and energy up the right side of the pitch, again baffled that it didn't happen. 


Anyways Fraudgate should be out after this. Foden had a stinker of a tournament and should be replaced by Palmer as he's been far effective in this setup. I loved the chemistry between Watkins and Palmer, hopefully the new manager can see how great they work with each other.",20,18

This has to be the end of Southgate era, England cannot keep playing this fucking type of football anymore under him. It's going to be complete waste of a generation of talent. I will give Southgate credit for bringing in young players when he first got the job and bringing stability to the national team but over time he's getting exposed in many areas on management.

Also Trent being on bench this much in a major tournament not even injured is just a high crime in Football. Especially when Trippier and Shaw have not  played since February. He 'experiments' Trent in midfield and gets sidelined ever since because of it yet refuses to try him in LB but gives it to Trippier.

Absolutely the correct result, Spain have been clearly the best side this entire tournament - only team that looked like they had ANY chance against them was Germany (of course I'm biased, being a Germany fan!). 

Also I can't deny I'm super happy England bottled it once again!",17,0

UEFA European Championship 2024,"Why the fuck we decided to sit back after the equaliser I'll never know, Spain were rattled, and if we'd actually pressed the advantage for longer than  minutes we would've got the second. 

Over the course of the tournament Spain were the deserved winners, think both teams didn't offer much in the final itself. 

Walker had an absolute disaster class though, pretty much everything he did was wrong. 

Blowing the whistle bang on  minutes was criminal given the ball had actually been in play for maybe  seconds of added time, and if England had been leading the world would've been screaming bloody murder at that.",9,2
UEFA European Championship 2024,With all due respect to Southgate. Get the fuck out. He's having a squad full of talents and he's playing football like an idiot. This was just an anti football for the whole tournament. Football won't come home until England find a normal manager. Being a England fan I would be really pissed.,3,2
UEFA European Championship 2024,SOUTHGATE INNNNNNNNNNN. Gotta love how people were acting as if he did a good job with England. Easiest road to a free championship with a great team and still played shit for most of it. BUT HEY THEY MADE IT TO THE FINALS SO HE MUST DO SOMETHING RIGHT.,0,18

UEFA European Championship 2024,"Gareth Southgate should be sacked or resign from the role this month.
He is not good enough.

No system or style of play. People can blame the players, even though some of them haven't been good.

I don't want England, playing defensively like a relegation side again. I know people will say that in International football you have to be more defensive, which kind of true to some extent. But teams like Spain and Germany have proved that notion wrong.

The English FA should look for a good head coach outside England. Clearly in England we don't produce a lot of good managers or the wrong people are being promoted into managers. I don't know the reason why, but I hope this addressed at least in the ten years within the English Game.

Graham Potter shouldn't be on the shortlist at all.

Eddie Howe ain't leaving Newcastle for England unless he is out of a job. So I don't want to see that suggestion.",10,27

UEFA European Championship 2024,"We held our own. We had our chances. We played with heart. No one made a mistake. A young, inexperienced squad has gained massive experience. We won a penalty shoot out. We won games facing adversity. We lost to the outright best team of the tournament. If I was offered this pre tournament I'd have took it gratefully. 

We do need a new manager, one more tactically astute but also able to galvanise a team with limited time. I don't believe there's a manager who can do that.

We need to be ruthless, drop Kane, Walker, Trippier and the last couple of old guard. Promote our younger players and programs into a new cycle. I expect a  year dip with earlier knock outs before another peak from - years out.

If Southgate is fired, I would bet any futures that include ""Foden less than . goals at  World Cup"" because Southgate isn't the reason he constantly fills space that isn't there and bogs down so much of England's buildup. Foden is. 

Stones and Walker were good this tournament, but they looked much less confident and coordinated with players like Guehi, Mainoo, Trippier, and Trent next to them than with Rodri and Ake. 

Southgate might be remembered as Roberto Martinez with Belgium for ruining England's ""golden generation"" when I think he should be remembered as a Fernando Santos with Portugal type - a poor manager who got blamed for his team's shortcomings even when they weren't his fault.",27,20

His entire value rests on being able to catch up with players like Man√©, Williams, Vinicius, Mbappe after they fucking rinse him

Foden and Saka could be high and go seek champions based on how invisible they were. What was Sakas role? Sit back  feet from goal and do nothing?

Thank you Southgate for getting us there and giving us a chance, time to move on though, there is so much talent in this team, we shouldn't be sitting back as much as we do, that's what cost us the second goal, not sure who the solution is but I don't think it's this.

Having a strong hold up play Striker is massive for us and Solanke does it perfectly. Kulus ability to bring the ball forward and escape a tackle is immense, Sons touch and lay offs were brilliant, and that's probably the best I've seen Madders in a Spurs shirt, goals aside his work ethic today was great, got around the pitch and made himself available and was happy to pitch in defensively. 

The fourth was just an icing on the cake. Werner and Johnson do love setting each other up.

Our forward press is so damn good, with even the midfield duo pushing up into Cities half and just making life difficult. Sarr and Bissouma did their jobs brilliantly. Not often we have games where I can say that no one had a bad game. 

Davies especially really has been the unsung hero of the last  years. Doesn't always play, but when he does he always gives his all, he'll go down as one of our underrated best. 

City wanted Doctor Tottenham, instead we got Doctor Pep with a jab of Cleansheet too. Vicario earned that too, some crucial saves and didn't look out of sorts whatsoever despite a difficult week with Italy.

Madders - come get your flowers. When he's on, he is the creative force we lacked for so long. 

Dragon - wow does he look so much better on the right side. Pairing him with Gentle Ben also works well given Ben's versatility and overall composure as a player. Do we think about pairing Dragon and Micky for stretches going forward?

He has had to instill a fearlessness in this young group so that they can go to the European Champions from a couple of years back and English Champions for years now and go toe to toe with them and play them off the park.

It has taken a while to come to fruition, and there have been bumps along the road, but Ange knows this is the only way.

Some of the football we played was unbelievable especially in the first half. Not many teams (if any) go to City and play like that. Thought it was a good sign that we stepped off in the second half and managed the game, even at two nil where it's always risky.

Match : EPL Away win Vs Man city. (notes taken during match). City unbeaten at home for  games. Back from a horrible int break we have lost our  cbs to injury.

But Madders scores from a simply super cross from kulu (started on rw) on our first serious counter-attack.  mins later Madders does it again! Masterful assist from sonny. It was a gvardiol def error that allowed it. Several fingertip saves from City GK and some vgood saves from Vic ended a very nice first half.

nd half: We came out nice and calm, a nice goal by Porro set up superbly by the fantastic Kulu\Solanke and Sonny combo, amazing, we are - up! The heavens open with torrential rain to celebrate!! When Spurs play like this you can watch them all day and night, it's beautiful. If its going to go wrong it will start now i suspect ( mins) but we are in control, city no shots on goal so far in this half. on m Son off for BJ, seems sensible enough, BJ takes left wing. We are making the champions look very ordinary today. Commentator: "" This is how good Spurs can be!"". Vic has made a string of excellent saves here.

As a Celtic fan I can predict pretty much exactly the process - because we all went through it. We were told by fans of his previous clubs it'll happen, happened to them and we didn't believe it either. Then it happened.

It will depend on who your first  fixtures are. If the season starts away at like a Man City then you're going to think the guy has lost his marbles because he'll line you up like --- or something, players all over the place, he's screaming from the sideline because your rightback didn't make the strikers run off the last defender and you'll think this isn't attacking football it's just sprint at the ball childrens stuff.

And yeah, you lose that game quite handily and it will look shit because City are really good and they aren't going to be phased by a team just disjointedly pressing them they'll carve you open. It'll be that for a couple of games, not everyone is a ManCity win some lose some. He'll try every player in the books, he'll banish a player you really like to the shadow realm and stubbornly keep playing somebody you think can't cut it.

Then you'll play I don't know.. Bournemouth and absolutely smash them. Not a ""Oh yeah it worked today because they were shite"" win, not a nice easy - stroll in the sunshine - a jesus christ stop they're already dead sort of win. Begging for a rest, just a touch of the ball that doesn't have  midfielders on me immediately

You feel it coming in the games before, you see the pieces starting to click and you think yeah bit more of this and it'll work. Then it really works. That is the moment you fall in love with Angeball, you think fuck yes I want to watch that every week.

Then you do it to a good team and that seals it. Just regular punters in the stands want to run through walls for the guy.",9,3
Premier League 2024,I expected this. I'm never scared of this game. But can the boys please go to Fulham and not embarrass us? I'll take a draw. For the love of God. Please!!!!,12,7
Premier League 2024,"Hey Lego man, that's how you play away to city",27,4
Premier League 2024,This feel good train is derailing next week isn't it?,7,0
Premier League 2024,Worth noting . This system NEEDS a left footer at CB,27,0
Premier League 2024,The same way teams that are down feel before seeing Dr. Tottenham is how this club feels before seeing Pep Guardiola. I'm glad that this club under every manager is able to cook this baldie.,17,15
Premier League 2024,Ange needs to stop subbing off son. He is the captain. He was playing well with really good assists. If he stayed on he would have bagged a goal or two,0,27
Premier League 2024,Tottenham get battered everywhere they go!!!,27,25
Premier League 2024,This result is completely pointless if we don't beat Fulham next weekend at home,10,9
Premier League 2024,Davies my beloved,27,0
Premier League 2024,Ben Davies is genuinely my hero. Fits that left side better than Dragusin. Only a shame he didn't get to put the armband on.,0,9
Premier League 2024,"Like many of us, said - Dragu just needs a partner in crime, and that partner is either Davies or VdV.",27,3
Premier League 2024,They were fantastic today. Like to the point I don't think our first choice CBs could have done any better.,0,6
Premier League 2024,Just a reminder this is City's first loss without a goal in nearly a year!,27,22
Premier League 2024,Brilliant games by both of them. Whole defense really. Whole team now that Im thinking about it.,0,27
Premier League 2024,"Ange solved the Dragusin passing problem by avoiding him like the plague 

Such a brilliant tactical tweak. Completely nullified their pressing plan",27,0
Premier League 2024,"Dragusin was rightly criticised over the Galatasaray game but it felt so over the top. Dude is perfectly fine. No one player well in the game, Davies, Forster and the fullbacks included",0,9
Premier League 2024,"Davies is so consistent, yes he isn't the most talented player but he gives everything, so important to have players like him in the squad",4,0
Premier League 2024,Davies is just elite. Wow,26,0
Premier League 2024,"I was thinking the clean sheet was my favorite part... but now it might be that we didn't just beat Man City, we embarrassed them.",12,22
Premier League 2024,They were so so so good. Possibly hot take but I think Dragusin was better fit for this match where we had to do lots of box defending than Romero.,0,27
Premier League 2024,They were magnificent. Especially Dragusin.,27,0
Premier League 2024,"Is it possible...

Could it be...

Is Dragusin a better centreback than Emerson Royal?",7,6
Premier League 2024,First CB pairing since King-Dawson to get us a clean sheet there.,27,4
Premier League 2024,"Big benny Davies, legend. He'll be calling his mumma tonight telling her all about his defensive master piece.",0,27
Premier League 2024,"Man I was roasting Dragusins after Gala, I thought he just was simply championship level, but he looked like a proper ball playing premier league CB today, hats off to him",27,9
Premier League 2024,Their lines were so straight. It's almost like there's a CB that plays all the time and is constantly out of position,27,3
Premier League 2024,I would never had believed,27,10

Premier League 2024,Romero CDM?,27,7
Premier League 2024,The importance of a left and right footed CB pairing is underrated,10,3
Premier League 2024,I'm telling you Romero is not welcome back ,27,3
Premier League 2024,First shut out in a long time for city at home. Some crazy stats are about to come out,3,27
Premier League 2024,I swear we always do better with a makeshift defence,4,27
Premier League 2024,"City should thank spurs for letting them win last season. 

Ain't no way son miss a clear  on  chance.",15,10
Premier League 2024,Was just thinking this. No way they can claim its a fluke this time lol,1,27
Premier League 2024,STAY HUMBLE! Was all I could think at the end.,27,22

Premier League 2024,SNIP SNAP,27,3
Premier League 2024,Make it make sense,27,4
Premier League 2024,so we'll either be losing to Roma or Fulham at home? not nice bruh,7,6
Premier League 2024,Gala is unbeaten though?,27,7
Premier League 2024,"Honestly in the first few minutes I thought we were in to be thrashed and that we looked tactically inept.

It's possible that the professionals at Spurs know more than me",27,0
Premier League 2024,"you lot dismantled them, comfortably at etihad",27,0
Premier League 2024,yeah unbelievable,26,13
Premier League 2024,"Great day for some players who have taken stick this season as well as the usual suspects. Vicario, Maddison, Uddogie and Porro were all fantastic",0,27
Premier League 2024,"Vic was truly amazing when called upon but man, credit to the team defense for limiting City's chances in the first place. I can't think of a player who doesn't deserve at least an / for their defending alone.",0,15
Premier League 2024,To the point where it stopped even being surprising. A howitzer wasn't getting one past him today,26,27
Premier League 2024,A game where his shot-stopping was matched by more authority in and around the box,27,0
Premier League 2024,"Great game but amazingly it wasn't like he was MOTM. Like, he was under siege, which is credit to the team",0,9
Premier League 2024,made Haaland look like prime Darius Vassell,27,0
Premier League 2024,"His best!  Stopped shots, confident on corners, played the ball well!",0,4
Premier League 2024,He should be starting over Donnurama on the national team.,27,7
Premier League 2024,"City hadn't lost a home game since  


Doctor Tottenham had a good visit",27,17
Premier League 2024,Plague spreader Tottenham got city really sick,9,25
Premier League 2024,"We've just beat the champions - and have scored the most goals in the league.

You'd have to be willingly pessimistic to not see our potential.",0,4

Premier League 2024,I'll take a double helping of the kool-aid please,27,4

Premier League 2024,"You can really tell the quality of a commenter's opinions based on their Ben Davies takes. The man is a rock, an unspectacular rock.",0,27
Premier League 2024,"Maddison's performance was /. Not many players across Europe have had a better game in midfield. He absolutely bossed it. Also, Kulusevski starting wide and constantly finding himself near Son and Udogie was beautiful",0,27
Premier League 2024,We need to find a way to continue having the Sarr-Biss pairing AND the Kulu-Madders pairing. Which means either Kulu on the wing (not my fav) or moving more into the --- type formation we saw today that Ange isn't super inclined to. But I think having Solanke in the middle with Son left and Kulu being free with Madders dropping deep can work. Along with Porro pushing high. Sarr is so important to me rn.,27,4
Premier League 2024,"Solanke has been such a key signing he may not score  goals, but he is the key to any success we have this season",4,20
Premier League 2024,Yikes I think we're going overboard here. City had many many chances to score. We weren't in control. On another day that's a loss. The same Ange defensive issues persist. And against low blocks that will continue to get exposed.,27,9
Premier League 2024,"I was only from , already kinda expected that next ",27,4
Premier League 2024,Soon as the rd goal went in I looked up our next fixtures to mark down the embarrassing defeat.. Roma have lost  out of  so it could be a two piece this coming week... I always feel like Fulham have our number especially if I fucking go to the game! I'll be staying at home .,3,12
Premier League 2024,Started in - here and haven't begun to understand this club.,22,6
Premier League 2024,Since . This is peak Spurs. I love it.,18,0
Premier League 2024,The most surprising thing would be for us to BEAT Fulham.,26,22
Premier League 2024,So well said. Pape biss and James dominated today hats off to all of em,0,15
Premier League 2024,And it'll kind of just continue that way for eternity. Unless?,27,20

Premier League 2024,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda. There's a reason we are able to beat City, United, Villa and lose to teams lower down. We still can struggle against stubborn teams that force us to play very high up. We are still an effective team on the counter and that suits us against sides that okay a high line against us",4,27
Premier League 2024,I don't think we can think like that. We never looked like beating Ipswich or Palace. Leicester had a lot of chances and we were lucky with the draw in the end. Only one I'd say we should've won was Brighton.,27,22

Premier League 2024,"Whaatt, that was incredibly pragmatic approach in the nd half, even down to the subs, and as someone who called for that change in Ange I was glad to see it. That is how you see out a - lead at half time, and then you sub on the runner in werner and get the winner on the counter. We have not always approached a nd half like we did that one, and even the advanced stats show we stopped producing chances in the nd half in exchange for a better hold on our shape. Our possession, field tilt, xG, and culmulative chances all went down in the nd half and that is NOT a bad thing, i was happy to see it and it was the right decision and got us a -.",15,17

Because Ange has dogmatically insisted our team plays the same way regardless of opponents, we are able to go there, take them on, and smash them at home.

Also real madrid ask a lot of him and most of the time don't really have him close to goal where he can pop up in the  yd box for chances.

Champions League 2024,"Vinicius has twice as much football as Mbapp in him and I'd wager even Rodrygo would've done better. His mentality is also one of the worst of the pitch. Sulking, feeling sorry for himself. Vinicius on his worst days always tries to put the team on his shoulders, causes some bust-up with the opponent for no reason and insults the ref's entire line because he didn't get an easy foul. 

Mbapp is just there. Loses the ball when he tries to dribble, misplaces a pass and causes a great counter by Liverpool time and time again. Vazquez, Ceballos and Fran Garc√≠a came on with more balls to try and turn the game around than Mbapp has shown in the past few months.

I've always thought it wrong for the fanbase to revere a player who has achieved nothing yet for Real Madrid and had only played the club like a fiddle in the past few years. Now you reap what you sow. No balls to sub him off. He has to play every game, and at least  minutes. Welcome to Mbapp FC. Truly the worst timeline. He won  Champions Leagues before coming here, and if he was the one leading us we'd win  while he's here. Thank god we have Vinicius.",15,3

Guler is very young and raw, he needs to improve a lot, and while there weren't better choices, I don't think a player like him should start at Anfield. Brahim is just not a striker, what the fuck was Carlo thinking playing him striker?

Mbappe is just void of confidence. He's geniuenly mentally not there. I'm not saying this as a insult but it's clear on his face that he is more afraid of doing a mistake than he is happy if it turns out okay. That penalty was also just sad to see. Instead of bringing his confidence higher, it's now probably in the ground even more.

Asensio is more than fit to be a starter. If he doesn't actually start atleast like  more games this season then Carlo is just demented.",2,3

. Liverpool has fast and strong centerbacks to neutralize Mbappe's pace.

Contest a loose ball? Not my problem.

A teammate makes a good run forward? It ain't me so why pass?

Don't get me wrong, Mbappe is one of the most talented players I've seen but I have watched/played football for many years, thousands of hours, and I cannot remember a worse professional player in my life. For the simple fact, that, he doesn't want to play football.

Even if he didn't have mental issues or whatever and his performances were top level, how would you fit him in the squad? He's not a CF and he doesn't want to play on the right.

Champions League 2024,Haven't played anyone above them in either the Premier or Champions League. % easy fixtures. Long may it continue.,27,7
Champions League 2024,This is the game that I'll now admit than you guys are the real deal to be fair.,4,27
Champions League 2024,"I don't watch him that regularly, but any time I've seen him the last  months, this is the type of performance I've seen.

Personally, I think it's all mental.  I think the nonsense at PSG and constantly worrying about money and nonsense has resulted in him just losing complete focus on what's needed to be a footballer.  If you look at players like Ronaldo or Messi, they had A+ professionalism.  Mbappe has always struggled with it, but now it's gotten really bad.

Big picture, Madrid supporters have to hope the next coach can get him focused again.  If they somehow bring Zidane back, I think that's a real possibility.  Not sure any other coach can do it.",9,20
Champions League 2024,It's always tough when you're up against the best right back in the business Conor Bradley,4,22
Champions League 2024,"His confidence is shot and the pressure is getting to him. 

His speed can't bail him out of the heavy and inaccurate touches. And because he's overthinking things, his touches are increasingly heavy and inaccurate. 

Watch his penalty. Before the whistle, he doesn't look at the ball. He doesn't look at the keeper, but to the side, presumably at the ref for the whistle. That's a nervous attitude, a lack of concentration. 

He needs to rediscover his strengths and work on his focus. Not sure he'll have the luxury of time at Madrid though",22,19
Champions League 2024,Eh. He's fit. His pace has recently returned. He's just not dribbling because he doesn't think he beat Liverpool's defenders and opt for passes instead.,27,4
Champions League 2024,He has been looking like that for months now,22,27
Champions League 2024,What players have looked any good against this Liverpool team this year?,7,9
Champions League 2024,Factos,27,3
Champions League 2024,"Genuinely don't think he was that horrible, just poor overall offense on the team.. he seemed to dribble well. Also had a terrible penalty which eclipses everything else.",27,10
Champions League 2024,"If by another you mean vinicius back, then yes",27,4
Champions League 2024,ONly because Endrick was throwing himself at Ibous legs the whole time the dirty little cunt.,3,2
Champions League 2024,yeah just that endricks only motivation was to hurt a liverpool player,27,25
Champions League 2024,Endrick is a cunt. Dude is stealing wages and just being a goon.,2,27
Champions League 2024,"I mean I am a Liverpool fan, but Madrid is really not just minus Vini. Cama went out injured, Carvajal, Alaba, Militao, Tchou, Rodrigo, Vini and I'm pretty sure I've dropped about a  more names on their injury list",27,4
Champions League 2024,He was one of the better players because Liverpool weren't afraid of him and let him roam free.,0,22
Champions League 2024,You haven't watched them this year then,27,10
Champions League 2024,Jude was more than decent given the circumstances IMO,27,4
Champions League 2024,"? He had some great passes, recoveries, and worked his ass off? Not a stellar performance but I wouldn't blame him",7,10
Champions League 2024,"I see you pr man, you can't fool me.",27,2
Champions League 2024,Found Bellingham's PR agency,27,3
Champions League 2024,What if a language model AI had been trained on r/soccer comments:,7,27
Champions League 2024,PR comment about the goat of PR,27,3
Champions League 2024,He's a cunt,2,27
Champions League 2024,He is good but this season he's not playing in a position that allows him to score goals. He's been picking up the slack of Mbappe and Vini defensively.,0,27
Champions League 2024,"As a Barca fan I can tell you didnt watch Iniesta play when he was .  Bellingham is pretty fucking Young man , give him a break .

He was way better last year when he didnt have to do Kroos job too",0,27
Champions League 2024,He's worth half a jones,27,4
Champions League 2024,"He was alright, he has to do all the hard work with lazy gits like Mbappe in the team.",27,4
Champions League 2024,"Tell u what, buy a time machine, go back to last year, and follow him through all the season  (not only CL and euros, but the league as well) and tell me how is he overrated? He was dominating most of the games he played, he dipped at the end but only because he was playing with an injury. He was awarded the MVP of the league and with good reason. This season he's been playing a different role, I wish he could go back, but he's still a machine. Absolutely not overrated.",0,9
Champions League 2024,It's insane you typing this he was BY FAR AND AWAY our best player and it's not even close,3,0
Champions League 2024,"Bellingham would be a generational player in another team that plays like a team.

This Real Madrid team is full of stars, the attention always shifts to those players instead of a workhorse like Bellingham, he'll never be noticed the right way nor appreciated.",27,22
Champions League 2024,I get your point but he's so sooo young. Probably not wise to call his career on what we've seen thus far,4,22
Champions League 2024,"Bellingham is good if you play him in his position as an .
Not a  or a .",27,4
Champions League 2024,It looks like they need to fill about  other positions before getting a right back like Trent,27,3
Champions League 2024,"Nahhh, let's get another left winger.",27,20
Champions League 2024,Slow down lol,1,27
Champions League 2024,I don't. Messi was great.,0,10
Champions League 2024,"Should have been -. Could have been -. 

We absolutely dominated them.",0,27
Champions League 2024,Yeh thanks to that entitled cunt endrick,15,27
Champions League 2024,"Dude's probably knackered as fuck, he plays literally every minute, including those on the international break.

Was already showing signs of fatigue against Milan",3,9
Champions League 2024,He was playing RB most of the game. Far from his best position.,22,9
Champions League 2024,"Brainless comment, he played rb until Cama left due to injury then played CDM.",27,0
Champions League 2024,"He was right back covering there, he was fine",27,4
Champions League 2024,lmao very convincing attempt at being gracious,1,27
Champions League 2024,The cope at the end,27,3
Champions League 2024,Also Endrick that cunt trying to injure Ibou.,27,11
Champions League 2024,We are on th now i believe lol,1,4
Champions League 2024, guarantees it,27,4
Champions League 2024,All of the remaining ones,27,3
Champions League 2024,Really?,7,26
Champions League 2024,The ref was absolutely awful,11,27
Champions League 2024,Actually,27,4
Champions League 2024,Yea,27,0
Champions League 2024,Liverpool is Fraudbappe father,27,4
Champions League 2024,Ali has a pretty poor pen record so maybe not. But there's literally  doubt who the better keeper and starter is lol,1,6
Champions League 2024,"considering he's very good at pens and it was a shit one - probably

but you cannot deny how good Kelleher is. He should be first choice keeper for a CL team

 mil plus Matt Turner",3,27
Champions League 2024,Pitch invader shooting the penalty for Real Madrid is blatant corruption /s,27,3
Champions League 2024, men?,27,7
Champions League 2024,"We were missing our  star players in Rodrygo and Vini plus our defense is in shambles. We played well, but Liverpool is on top of their game. It went as expected. I don't think it would've been as one sided if we were at full strength. We did learn that Mbappe is not Madrid quality and I'm not sure if he ever will be after this game.",6,22
Champions League 2024,This is you with Mbappe bro,27,4
Champions League 2024,We gonna act like mbappe signing was not supposed to be enough?,6,27
Champions League 2024,It's not your life. Nobody gives a shit about you.,2,3
Champions League 2024,"I mean if any team deserves something from the City being shit, it is Liverpool. We have suffered a lot of agony with this City machine. 

You guys have done well but you have only suffered twice (really only last season).",9,0
Champions League 2024,i miss when arsenal was shit and you guys couldn't make everything about yourselves,9,11
Champions League 2024,No one is entitled to anything! Long season to go! You guys have been great last two games,0,4
Champions League 2024,Peak mentality,27,0
Champions League 2024,Arsenal don't deserve anything..,10,3
Champions League 2024,A very empty book of late isn't it,27,7
Champions League 2024,What about the Bradley tackle?,7,27
Champions League 2024,You poor soul,9,25
Champions League 2024,Lol. Try being a Man United fan my friend.,1,22
Champions League 2024,"There is no greater joy in this life, and no heavier burden, than being a Real Madrid fan.",9,25
Champions League 2024,Don't disappoint yourself more,5,23
Champions League 2024,"Sucks to see your team lose but like, remind yourself that it's not actually relevant to your life wether these guys put the ball in. You care because you want to and choose to. Do something you like, call a friend, go to sleep and you'll feel better tomorrow.",5,22
Champions League 2024,Real Madrid were the ones with No offense yesterday tho..,27,4
Champions League 2024,Vini was there for the - whoopin,27,0
Champions League 2024,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

RM got Mbappe and it threw a wrench in the squad and everyone's roles changed a bit to accommodate Mbappe and Vini playing at the same time.",27,4
Champions League 2024,I don't know what you watched lol he was busy but crap,10,6
Champions League 2024,"Yes?

Haland/ronaldo/messi/whoever you want missed pens, every player misses pens",27,9
Champions League 2024,Who won the pen?,7,6
Champions League 2024,"No, that single missed penalty has changed our opinions entirely. He's just an  season wonder. Bin him off.",3,27
Champions League 2024,Most definitely yes...  years atleast and he'll be in top  all time scorers of PL  atleast,4,27
Champions League 2024,John Henry liked this,18,27
Champions League 2024,"Salah shouldn't be our penalty taker but this season he is crazy good. Like today, we can manage without Trent but we can't play without salah.",0,4
Champions League 2024,There is no reason for unnecessary hair measuring. Just enjoy hair and baldness bro.,4,17
Champions League 2024,Why make this about Arsenal?,7,27
Champions League 2024,This thread isn't about Arsenal,27,10
Champions League 2024,Rent free,27,4
Champions League 2024,Anyone actually say that?,27,7
Champions League 2024,Zzz,27,2
Champions League 2024,Look Arsenal fans have been on another one lately seeing as they thought it would be them capitalizing on a City down year but there's not really much basis to say Slot is better than Arteta yet. What Arteta has done with Arsenal is the sign of a great manager. The question remains if he's the one to get them over the line or not,27,22
Champions League 2024,Insane take,27,3
Champions League 2024,Yeah the guy that won  CL's is overrated. Reactionary statements like this scream of low intelligence.,3,27
Champions League 2024,Good lord,0,4
Champions League 2024,This is certainly a take,27,4
Champions League 2024,"Bro this is not the time, accept the loss and move on",5,27
Champions League 2024, > ,27,7
Champions League 2024,Says the plastic with a foot fetish,27,3
Champions League 2024,This just comes across as very bitter. Just avoid social media if you can't handle losing.,5,9
Champions League 2024,"Which is true, Liverpool have  points to Madrids  and as a result are ahead of Madrid in the league. Good job with numbers",0,4
Champions League 2024,Lol u have no injury crisis.,1,17
Champions League 2024,Lmao,1,27
Champions League 2024,"friendly reminder our first choice keeper (arguably best in the world) and cf are out injured at the moment, as well as our starting rb (maybe the best in the world, although he is on the bench)",27,22
Champions League 2024,Just like when Arsenal beat Liverpool last season.,22,27
Champions League 2024,"Liverpool have had Alisson, Jota and Trent out injured for periods, as well as Elliott, Tsimikas and others. I know Arsenal fans think only they get injuries, but do some research",27,22
Champions League 2024,Always an arsenal fan crying in the corner. Liverpool also have injuries but that doesn't fit your narrative,25,27
Champions League 2024,"Lmao this is the new Arsenal cope:
- Liverpool haven't played any good
- Liverpool haven't played anyone good when they're fit
- Liverpool haven't played anyone good away from home
- Liverpool haven't played anyone good while Arteta plays YNWA over the speakers at Arsenal's training ground",1,27
Champions League 2024,"Let's not act like Alison, Trent, Jota, Elliot and Chiesa are all injured.",27,25
Champions League 2024,what‚Äòs the next excuse going to be for you?,7,27
Champions League 2024,Because we haven't got injuries ourselves? Give it a rest,5,7
Champions League 2024,"You played us during an injury crisis, it's not our fault your clubs fragile top to bottom",27,9
Champions League 2024,Wah wah wah! Always the crying little bitches.,2,25
Champions League 2024,"They had a great game against a team that's beat them in big games before, don't be a weirdo of course they're happy",0,17
Champions League 2024,Learn to accept defeats(I am madrid fan),27,5
Champions League 2024,Congrats you chose to support a club across the world who have won a lot. Do you want a medal for that tough decision?,7,0
Champions League 2024,No one does salt like Madrid fans!,27,3
Champions League 2024,Cry harder,27,5
Champions League 2024,Cry me a river. We've got a higher chance on winning it this season than Los Francos. You lot just focus on making it through to the RO.,27,4
Champions League 2024,"You're rattled as hell lil bro. Madrid beat Liverpool in the knockouts when they had no CB's and the other time dead midfield. They've not played Liverpool when they're good except the finals which they were dominated in especially ,  Ratmos did what he did.",3,9
Champions League 2024,"By ""acting like UCL winners"" you mean efficiently beating one of the top rated sides in Europe who spend ridiculous amounts of money on players?",6,27
Champions League 2024,Wtf? Jones and Macca were bossing that midfield.,7,27
Champions League 2024, shutup man,27,3
Champions League 2024,Hahahahha,1,17
Champions League 2024,Be lovely to welcome you guys at Anfield again to show you our lack of midfield in person.,18,8
Champions League 2024,They played Real Madrid off the park tbh,27,3
Champions League 2024,"Grav and Jones ran rings around them, bullied them and are  of our best performers this season, talking out of your hole",0,27
Champions League 2024,Pissed all over them like a camp fire before bed time,27,3
Champions League 2024,The amount of PL bias in this sub is crazy lol,1,3
Champions League 2024,Bellingham was the only attacker for us tonight,27,4
Champions League 2024,Bellingham was good today. Covered a lot of ground and was a presence in both defence and offence. He is like  players on the pitch.,0,27
Champions League 2024,Stop it,27,3
Champions League 2024,"Grand Irish name, his da was probably a RA man",27,7
Champions League 2024,"Being from the Republic and being republican are different things. Although most of the time, if you're one, you're the other.",27,22
Champions League 2024,"Connor is the definition of Republican lol. Nice to see him playing for us though, big improvement in things.",1,0
Champions League 2024,How's Brexit working for ya,7,6
Champions League 2024,Yeah you let Thatcher handle them. You fuck,2,3
Champions League 2024,Cant blame him. Caoimhin's name looks like Tolkien came up with it.,27,4
Champions League 2024,Kelleher is the best nd keeper in the world,0,4
Champions League 2024,Not tonight he didn't,27,10
Champions League 2024,Perez will die before he sells Mbappe. Never gonna happen unfortunately,25,27
Champions League 2024,,27,10
Champions League 2024,Always hate it when we're playing against him. It's almost like we create a lot more chances for them to be saved,3,27
Champions League 2024,nd best keeper on the pitch tonight,0,27
Champions League 2024,"Let's just pray they get eliminated so we don't need to face him again, he hates us as much as we hate him.",5,2
Champions League 2024,x,27,1
Champions League 2024,"Don't know why Real Madrid didn't just employ the same tactics as that night. Ref was lenient, I reckon they could have assaulted  Liverpool players without issue.",27,10
Champions League 2024,"He's ' with an enormous wingspan. It's so much easier for him to cover ground than the average keeper, there's no way there isn't an added psychological impact for players playing against him, knowing they have to be inch perfect to beat him.",27,0
Champions League 2024,That's just his normal performance. He's rarely flashy but he's pretty much flawless every game and has been bailing out Madrid for years,0,27
Champions League 2024,"He's such a massive prospect, Connor.",4,0
Champions League 2024,his generation did bring back cargo pants,27,4
Champions League 2024,No issue at all for the nd best RB in the world,0,4
Champions League 2024,"Madrid's head is turned. No contract to Trent after all, they're sending a  figure offer Liverpool's way for Bradley.",27,3
Champions League 2024,Loved his performance.,18,0
Champions League 2024,In fairness I'm barely over that and I was a neutral.,27,4
Champions League 2024,Way before that. He only performed in the final,27,22
Champions League 2024,"Mbapp is giving dyslexia to Madrid fans, that's how bad he is",9,3
Champions League 2024,"Too early to bench him, especially with ardas performance today",27,0
Champions League 2024,"Absolutely zero effort. 

Bro got tackled by Mo Salah lmfao",27,9
Champions League 2024,"False, he had / successful passes to Kelleher",10,27
Champions League 2024,"I'm madrid supporter and agree with you that Guler is raw. But It's mostly the Turkey fans, not Madrid fans hyping him that much.",4,27
Champions League 2024,"Guler is the Turkish Paulo Henrique Ganso. Insanely talented, but the physicality simply isn't there.",0,4
Champions League 2024,the Barcelona hate watch went so crazy tonight,27,13
Champions League 2024,"Don't bother with people like them, I give it two weeks and they'll sing the same song again. Guler is talented but he's very weak and is not ready.",0,27
Champions League 2024,the Guler PR is insane. There are weekly reports from Madrid accounts about him scoring golazos in training lmao,27,1
Champions League 2024,Yamal is a threat. Guler is a warm body who makes sideways passes.,27,2
Champions League 2024,He has barely played and he has looked good in every game except this game.,0,10
Champions League 2024,"honestly yea, I just wish he'd press and at least work on other areas of his game when maybe the shooting or attacking isn't falling, but he'll just run at  defenders and try dribble around them when he should be passing more, or he'll drill a pass at the attacker when it should be floated, he just doesn't seem to think during the game

Mbappe seems to be in his own head now and it's affecting him, I don't think Ancelotti's tactics have helped, but now that Vini is out there's no excuse for him not to step up, especially in his natural position slightly left",27,8
Champions League 2024,At least PSG will know that he'll light up the farmers league when they buy him.,27,20
Champions League 2024,Ligue  is casually strolling in the UCL this year,27,1
Champions League 2024,"> Fraudappe 

now this is / material",27,7
Champions League 2024,no it's really an individual problem for mbappe. he's disinterested in most aspects of the game compared to (most of his years at) PSG.,27,10
Champions League 2024,Gonna be hilarious if he never wins the ballon d'or or european golden shoe tho.,1,17
Champions League 2024,He did not carry France to a WC final. He was not impactful in the quarters and semis. Griezmann did a big carry job there. And even in the final; Mbappe was invisible most of the game. His first shot was around the th minute. He showed up in a few moments that mattered but it wasn't a carry job at all.,27,10
Champions League 2024,He didn't carry anyone lol.,27,1
Champions League 2024,"I didn't watch this game obviously so I don't know if it worse but there was a game after the world Cup away to nice where this guy was absolutely diabolical, if this was somehow worse than that then jeez lmao.",6,9
Champions League 2024,Kylian McFrappe is back on the menu,27,10
Champions League 2024,He is one of the most athletic players in our team.,0,27
Champions League 2024,Kept hearing that one bloke‚Äòs beautiful singing on the TNT mics ,0,13
Champions League 2024,It's % a bigger game lmao,1,4
Champions League 2024,"Much bigger. Qualifying in the top  in the CL isn't in doubt, whereas  vs  points in the league is massive.",27,22
Champions League 2024,"In no reasonable world should we be able to hold you to a draw let alone beat you in our current form, which makes me believe we'll somehow take the  points from Anfield. 

Put the tin foil hat all the way on",27,20
Champions League 2024,"It's madness, Alisson is just too good to get ahead of but he deserves to start games, I just wish we could keep him.


TNT have just said he's saved / penalties he's faced, he's just class.",0,8
Champions League 2024,It is a Neuer - Ter Stegen in Germany's NT situation.,27,3
Champions League 2024,"Can't speak much to Kelleher outside of what I saw tonight, but I can tell you right away that Mamardashvilli is world class, and down right awful to play against.",11,3
Champions League 2024,I really really really hope West Ham go in for him,20,8
Champions League 2024,Is he definitely going? Where?,7,6
Champions League 2024,"Just this season? He was awesome when he covered for allison last season, the results were noticeably worse when he came back in goal!

Kelleher is awesome, hard to get a keeper with those prospects to remain a number  though",0,9
Champions League 2024,generous to call mbappe that rn,27,4
Champions League 2024,"Yeah possibly, it's difficult though because he's not on that level but he's too good to lose, especially as Alisson does miss games.",9,27
Champions League 2024,"Alisson ball distribution is at another level tho.

I actually think he's the better keeper in every single aspect, but his ball distribution is what makes even more of a difference between them. I like Kelleher, he should definitely be a starter at top club.",0,27
Champions League 2024,seen people calling him Enprick lol,1,27
Champions League 2024,"Damm that highlight. You'd think the guy is + and a CB to have this kind of highlight reels but no, he's  and a barely mcm striker.",3,9
Champions League 2024,"Wow, what a piece of shit.",26,2
Champions League 2024,Someone needs to go full Ramos on him.,27,3
Champions League 2024,What the fuck was that against Cucurella(?) ? Endrick was deliberately kicking him,2,7
Champions League 2024,Hitting back in all of these. Show the whole game. Same story with that douchebag CB from Alaves(?) he kneed.,3,27
Champions League 2024,Pfff like you've seen enough of him to say that lol,1,27
Champions League 2024,Yeah Ramos and Pepe are heros for these cunt like behaviors. And surprisingly ( or maybe not) they always tend to get away with these acts.,26,0
Champions League 2024,Real fans and players are the most disgraceful bunch in football.,9,10
Champions League 2024,"They celebrated Kroos taking Pedri out of the Euros, and no that wasn't an accident Kroos always aims high when tackling but Madrid PR is insanely good

And we don't need to bring up Carvajal who might kill someone someday with his pushes to airborne players and somehow never getting called for a foul",27,0
Champions League 2024,"Not to bat for Madrid here, but that's rich coming from a dude who probably cheers every time Ara√∫jo tries to break Vini's legs",17,27
Champions League 2024,It is insane how much of a Madrid complex you guys have.,3,27
Champions League 2024,Utter woke nervousness,19,14
Champions League 2024,Crazy what happens when you give academy products opps,26,27
Champions League 2024,"I don't know what Slot told them at HT but they somehow came out even fresher than in the first half. Even until the very end, they were breaking at full pace.

Someone needs to check Slot's drinks, he might be borrowing his fellow bald fraud's recipes",27,6
Champions League 2024,They were shite mainly because we dominated them tbf. Absolutely pressed them into a corner.,3,2
Champions League 2024,"Also we were incapable to do a single counter effectively every time we try either Kylian would try to get the ball in his feet and loose it or his runs were off, very annoying",3,27
Champions League 2024,"People say this, but it's Madrid. They should be just fine with some backups. We're down our Starting RB, GK and ST too you know.",27,4
Champions League 2024,Looking forward to being told we still haven't played any hard games,27,20
Champions League 2024,Where's the  from?,27,7
Champions League 2024,"Completely agreed mate. I would be open for J Gomez starting Left back also, he is seriously underrated",4,3
Champions League 2024,Isn't he algerian ?,7,6
Champions League 2024,"With the way his playing by  years, he'll be worth a er and pack of gums.",27,20
Champions League 2024,Vini have gifted him a bunch of goals and pens.,27,0
Champions League 2024,"You might not believe me but Vini is literally missing at least  assists due to him. It's astounding to me as to how magnanimous Vini is, trying to help and support him (perhaps he is that secure in his standing within the team or perhaps he's that much of a team player because he hypes up others as well). The entire team is trying to help him as best as they can but he has only been sliding further and further. Even when he came here, he wasn't there but there were certainly signs of promise. Today, he literally didn't do single thing right. Literally. I challenge everyone to point out even  bright moment from him tonight. Misplaced simple  years passes as well. [Sadly it's been a theme.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/gyyscs/comment/lyvqgkn) Today there neither Vini, nor Rodrygo and this was his what performance or the season. Literally couldn't be poorer if one tried. Now even that excuse is gone.",9,25
Champions League 2024,He was shit before that.,27,3
Champions League 2024,Wonder where his next move will be. Kid is class and will have every big club moving for him in the summer,26,20
Champions League 2024,It's in the name i mean. He dibbles very well.,27,4
Champions League 2024,"Slot's style suits him better, maybe even Gravenberch too. We're more tight in the middle and our backline is more secure which allows players like Curtis to play their game, even when they lose the ball we got others close enough to cover.

Klopp's ball is more open so we can't afford our midfielders expressing themselves in our own half, which was why Wijnaldum, Fabinho, Henderson were so effective because they just play it simple.",0,22

Champions League 2024,"It is a lot more patient and less frenetic than it was with Klopp. Some elements like counter attacks from opponent set-pieces are still there, but much more patient with the ball. Not forcing it as much around the opponents box. More willing to take low percentage shots from time to time.

Where Klopp would be frustrated by low block teams not wanting to engage, Slot is perfectly happy to keep the ball and build pressure through possession.

One of the big differences between the previous and current version is under Klopp, we would crank up the pressure after scoring to try and get a second quickly. They don't do that as much under Slot, which makes it feel more like a tightrope walk, but the stats show we are actually conceding less chances and xG this season, so it is more solid.",27,4
Champions League 2024,"Bit of both.

The basic foundations are there (counter pressing, being direct) but slot has different implementations of the same ideas.

Klopp almost exclusively played --, slot is more flexible and he plays a flexible --- that shifts between a -- or -- depending on phase of play. The overall play is less aggressive, more control, but also more solid defensively. The full backs are less influential in his system, but the wingers are more influential and asked to do more. 

You could say he was lucky to inherit the right caliber of players who already have a general idea of how to play his system, but he's also been very effective in tweaking to suit the players he has and communicating what he wants and implementing it. 

One thing that is evident about slot vs klopp is that he is much more flexible tactically, and I even think his game management is better. There have been  or  games already where his side starts slow, he takes the first half to figure out what the other side is doing, then makes big changes at half time and turns the game around. He isn't against ugly and pragmatic tactics.

It isnt all rosy though, the team does look vulnerable if you have a team capable of playing through your press and he's been quite reliant on a few players.",27,0
Champions League 2024,"Latter. Slowed the game and put more emphasis on possession, control, and recycling the ball instead of springing counters. Kind of still feasting on the attacking movements Klopp coached as many goals still come from either counters or set pieces, but he's given the team control over games which was at times lacking last year",27,0
Champions League 2024,"He's tweaked things here and there but not much more than that, the style is very similar to the way the team played in the - and - seasons, which Klopp only changed because of injury issues, ageing midfielders and the midfield revamp, the only really big differences are in the ways Gravenberch, Diaz, Gakpo and Alexander-Arnold are being played.


Beyond personnel they aren't as intense for the full  minutes, they'll almost rest during periods when they're ahead or during the first half and let the opposition tire before killing them off during the nd half. At timesthe buildup is more patient and the team sometimes fall back very deepin posession to draw teams onto them instead of trying to suffocate teams on the edge of their own box. There's possibly more dribbling through midfield but I think that's more of a personnel thing.",27,22

Champions League 2024,"We'll live if that's the case. 

Personally I'm not very impressed by how Madrid have acted in the last weeks if I'm a player considering a future there especially on the merit of earning personal accolades from everything around the ownership, PR, management, and performances. 

Nobody is bigger than the club but if he stays he'll be generational. You have to think he knows that and the club does too. We won't hear anything from any of the contracts until we're about to hear from all  of them and that won't happen until the talking stage opens up come the end of December. Anything in the air right now is pure management-driven spin by all parties. 

Madrid needs Trent more than Trent needs Madrid. From his own words around how much more certain victories with clubs mean than to others and how he wants to be a legacy - from being a local young fan sneaking a peak at Gerrard training - it would seem idiotic to leave the current Liverpool for the fire that is Madrid. 

And no, I don't think the Spanish climate means as much to people as it might've  years ago. No, I don't think him being mates with Jude affects things any more than when Liverpool was the apparent target of the aforementioned who was likewise friends with our own Trent. 

These contracts now will be era defining for Trent and probably career summating for Van Dijk and Salah. They will be immense and they will be committal.

No he wasn't. Mbappe already scored more goals than Hazard did during his whole spell at Madrid.

The injuries he had were a factor also, but every time he was fit the fans believed this has to be his time, and he never delivered. I remember a match vs th league team in the CdR when Hazard was actually unable to dribble defenders, was losing the ball, his movement was slow and predictable. He was a bum at that moment.

What more does Kelleher have to do to be ?",27,22

Having said that, I agree with you that this can't be an excuse. Most of all, none of this has no bearing on Arda's but most of all, Kylian's performance. 

Mbapp sucked the entire life out of the team and we progressively got worse. Even with fitter players, such a performance would have doomed us. 

Plus, history books don't care. Liverpool beats Madrid and deserves all the credit. I just wanted to provide context of just how dire the injury situation at Madrid is. It's infinitely worse than Bar√ßa, which is some statement.",9,3

Champions League 2024,"Two fouls and people are acting like he tried to murder somebody. Two fouls which didn't cause any injuries. 

Konate got injured because both him and Van Dijk closed down Endrick, who was the only one actually chasing the ball btw, and caused him to fall on Konate. It sucks, but it's the nature of the game. They went looking for physical contact, not the other way around.",27,3

Champions League 2024,"I mean he didn't get his popularity for nothing. He's been huge for PSG, France and Monaco when he was there. Sure Ligue  is easier to be good in than other leagues, but he was heads over anyone else there for the majority of his tenure. He probably needs a different system and the tactics to be made around him to be at his best, which imo downplays his ¬´best in the world¬ª status, but being a system player doesn't mean you're not necessarily world class",27,22

At least Szobo keeps his head down and works % for us.",0,22
Champions League 2024,"I think the assessment is completely skewed  though, Trent's defensive performance has been constantly held up by both the system and whoever plays right center back. One of the reasons Konate took Quansahs spot (not saying Quansah should have kept it anyway) is because the responsibility to cover a ridiculous amount of ground and win physical duels because of Trent is much higher than whoever plays on the left side. It's because of Trent. People just look at the fact the team as a whole is better defensively and conceding less chances and thinks that means Trent has magically just improved defensively this season.",22,27
Champions League 2024,"Yeah weird cause even Liverpool supporters can admit that Trent needs to be babysat for Liverpool, it's a part of the reason why Quansah lost his spot because when you play on the right side of Liverpools central defense you have to cover a much bigger amount of territory when Trent is playing vs on the left side.",22,27

Champions League 2024,"B team hahahahahahaha, wonder how much that B team costs",1,26
Champions League 2024,"That was a slight factor, but most of that is that his purple patch simply ended. Expecting him to score  goals in  games or whatever continuously was a delusional r/soccer thing, he doesn't have the characteristics or the skillset for that. He continued to have the same role as the physical central threat in the area, he just had less luck. If there was any tactical way to unlock the form he had in those first  games of the season, Ancelotti would opt for that because those were absurd numbers - but there isn't. An extremely lucky patch can't be reproduced.",27,9

Do we let Kelleher walk just for Ali to get hurt again next year and hope Gio is as good as Kelleher when Kelleher is ready right now?

Would be a difficult decision and one I think they are unlikely to make, but Kelleher has been top class this year.",20,0
Champions League 2024,"That's fair. I'm just worried we are going to let the next great keeper go somewhere else while Allison struggles for fitness.

In fairness it's largely probably recency bias. Just sucks to lose a player who has been so good for us.",19,9
Champions League 2024,A bid is a bid. You missed out on the American spider.,27,9
Champions League 2024,"He's a better shot stopper than McCarthy.

He is an excellent player, but not a great all around player (which he doesn't have to be like Ronaldo).

I'm saying a team's form is a fragile ecosystem where changing one thing affects every other player. And throwing Mbappe in there changed the way every other player had to play which adds up to a lot.

In what may have been his shittiest game yet in that cup, he got the ball to Giroud in the box for the first goal in the knockout match against Poland, and then scored two top corner goals to seal the win.

Mbappe did have more quieter games in the quarters and semi matches, but even there he wasn't bad. He ended up with  goals and  assists in his  starts before the final, and it's not like he was only scoring tap ins or penalties. Griezmann was the better player until the final, but anyone who wants to pretend that he somehow waited till the game against Argentina to play well is absolutely not worth taking seriously",9,3
Champions League 2024,"did you watch the game or just the highlights

he didn't assist or anything but the reason the ball was so high up the pitch was because he progressed it during a transition",7,27

point is that Mbappe is now struggling in a top league - showcasing that his World Cup performances were perhaps not the best indication of his world class ability: 

- Australia 
- Denmark 
- Poland 

not exactly world class or top level teams. Granted Argentina is, and the world cup final is THEE best stage to do it in. 

look, the anti-Mbappe crowd is likely being hyperbolic here. Mbappe is one of the world's best strikers - perhaps of his generation. we're being super reactionary and harsh because we held Mbappe to such a high standard and he chose to stay at PSG. He's now looking like an absolute flop and it's his own doing.

his legacy will be less rose tinted if he doesn't turn up at Real Madrid or another top level league. that's the price for being legendary.",0,22
