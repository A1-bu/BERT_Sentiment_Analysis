"Absolutely superb performance today. The front  were superb. The link up play between them was brilliant. All  players complimented each other beautifully. Having a strong hold up play Striker is massive for us and Solanke does it perfectly. Kulus ability to bring the ball forward and escape a tackle is immense, Sons touch and lay offs were brilliant, and that's probably the best I've seen Madders in a Spurs shirt, goals aside his work ethic today was great, got around the pitch and made himself available and was happy to pitch in defensively. 

The fourth was just an icing on the cake. Werner and Johnson do love setting each other up.

Our forward press is so damn good, with even the midfield duo pushing up into Cities half and just making life difficult. Sarr and Bissouma did their jobs brilliantly. Not often we have games where I can say that no one had a bad game. 

Davies especially really has been the unsung hero of the last  years. Doesn't always play, but when he does he always gives his all, he'll go down as one of our underrated best. 

City wanted Doctor Tottenham, instead we got Doctor Pep with a jab of Cleansheet too. Vicario earned that too, some crucial saves and didn't look out of sorts whatsoever despite a difficult week with Italy.

Kulu is one of the best players in the world right now. His strength and ability to navigate tight spaces is just insane. Biss is also in the best sustained form that we've seen since his transfer - absolutely elite at winning the ball back and staying composed. 

Madders - come get your flowers. When he's on, he is the creative force we lacked for so long. 

Dragon - wow does he look so much better on the right side. Pairing him with Gentle Ben also works well given Ben's versatility and overall composure as a player. Do we think about pairing Dragon and Micky for stretches going forward?

It has taken a while to come to fruition, and there have been bumps along the road, but Ange knows this is the only way.

Some of the football we played was unbelievable especially in the first half. Not many teams (if any) go to City and play like that. Thought it was a good sign that we stepped off in the second half and managed the game, even at two nil where it's always risky.

"Continuing my match notes:
Match : EPL Away win Vs Man city. (notes taken during match). City unbeaten at home for  games. Back from a horrible int break we have lost our  cbs to injury. In their place are Ben Davis and Dragusin. Bentacur starts  match ban. Bookies have us at \ to win. Biss on a yellow card within  seconds. City total domination first  mins. But Madders scores from a simply super cross from kulu (started on rw) on our first serious counter-attack.  mins later Madders does it again! Masterful assist from sonny. It was a gvardiol def error that allowed it. Several fingertip saves from City GK and some vgood saves from Vic ended a very nice first half.

nd half: We came out nice and calm, a nice goal by Porro set up superbly by the fantastic Kulu\Solanke and Sonny combo, amazing, we are - up! The heavens open with torrential rain to celebrate!! When Spurs play like this you can watch them all day and night, it's beautiful. If its going to go wrong it will start now i suspect ( mins) but we are in control, city no shots on goal so far in this half. on m Son off for BJ, seems sensible enough, BJ takes left wing. We are making the champions look very ordinary today. Commentator: "" This is how good Spurs can be!"". Vic has made a string of excellent saves here. Subs Timo and BJ (back at rw) score on mins to make it -. A spurs masterclass. Every single player did his bit. MOTM Kulu. Happy birthday Madders.",1732391127,1,:classic-logo-08:,0,22

As a Celtic fan I can predict pretty much exactly the process - because we all went through it. We were told by fans of his previous clubs it'll happen, happened to them and we didn't believe it either. Then it happened.

It will depend on who your first  fixtures are. If the season starts away at like a Man City then you're going to think the guy has lost his marbles because he'll line you up like --- or something, players all over the place, he's screaming from the sideline because your rightback didn't make the strikers run off the last defender and you'll think this isn't attacking football it's just sprint at the ball childrens stuff.

And yeah, you lose that game quite handily and it will look shit because City are really good and they aren't going to be phased by a team just disjointedly pressing them they'll carve you open. It'll be that for a couple of games, not everyone is a ManCity win some lose some. He'll try every player in the books, he'll banish a player you really like to the shadow realm and stubbornly keep playing somebody you think can't cut it.

Then you'll play I don't know.. Bournemouth and absolutely smash them. Not a ""Oh yeah it worked today because they were shite"" win, not a nice easy - stroll in the sunshine - a jesus christ stop they're already dead sort of win. Begging for a rest, just a touch of the ball that doesn't have  midfielders on me immediately

You feel it coming in the games before, you see the pieces starting to click and you think yeah bit more of this and it'll work. Then it really works. That is the moment you fall in love with Angeball, you think fuck yes I want to watch that every week.

Then you do it to a good team and that seals it. Just regular punters in the stands want to run through walls for the guy.",1732518704,1,,9,3

People didn't lose their heads about the players though. Most of the focus was on Ange. And you'll see the most varied discourses and theories. This week we had like  posts a day about a TalkSport (tabloid) article about players turning on Ange, and that's why we should get rid of him! After the Palace loss it was on how playing out the back doesn't work because because?

People losing their heads are dumb regardless. Anyone with eyes can see that when players give their all, we play to win. They even said that themselves in interviews, multiple times. Brighton, Ipswich and Palace were games the players didn't want it more than the opposition. Ange clearly did.",1732402051,4,:image_udogie: Destiny Udogie,22,27

Ultimately it depends on how many bumps is acceptable, which is personal opinion. And for me, it's a little too much.  months and  transfer windows is enough to gauge a collective (manager and squad), and there are too many results that i feel (and others) are avoidable - which loops right back to your first initial post.

"The result IS proof it is working.

To win the title, you have to play a dominating style against the very best.

No one, in  games, has done that to City.

Even our rivals down the road, a long way advanced in their development, still go there and park the bus.

This result shows how advanced we are with our mentality. 

It shows we are not far off real success.

Ange wants to win the title. Being dogmatic like this is the only way to do it. Teams who don't dominate possession no longer win the Premier League. Leicester we're the last one. There will be pain until it clicks but that is the only way a team learns to play in this way.

"Watched the game, don't need stats. 

City are such an incredible team, - down at home, there will always be a response, hence any stat differential you are amazingly putting down to pragmatism. They keep possession better than any team that's existed.

The team got this win by playing with courage at the champions.

Pretty much every team, including our rivals, go there for a draw.

Because Ange has dogmatically insisted our team plays the same way regardless of opponents, we are able to go there, take them on, and smash them at home.

This result is something that happens due to Ange's dogmatic insistence on playing a certain style regardless of opponent.

Not due to pragmatism, as much as you moaners will try and twist things now.",1732394353,4,,0,3
